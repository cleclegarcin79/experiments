African Women Confront Bush's AIDS PolicyRebecca Lolosoli radiates a quiet authority beneath layers of elaborate beadwork that cover her forehead, neck, chest, and wrists. She smiles readily while addressing an audience of U.S. college students, though to them, her topic is a metaphor for hopelessness. Rebecca is talking about AIDS in Africa, specifically among women in her indigenous, Samburu village of Umoja, Kenya. “For years, people were dying and we did not know why,” she recalls. “Now we know that AIDS can be avoided, but only by making great changes in our lives.”Thanks largely to the work of African public-health and social-justice advocates like Rebecca, growing numbers of people around the world know that sub-Saharan Africa is the epicenter of the AIDS pandemic: three-quarters of AIDS deaths worldwide have been in Africa, and today the continent is home to nearly two-thirds of all of those who are HIV-positive (more than 25 million people). Fewer people know that most Africans living with HIV/AIDS are women, and that young women are now being infected at a rate three to four times higher than young men. For many, this information is absorbed through a mesh of stereotypes that make human misery seem like a natural condition of life in Africa .But while AIDS—like the litany of this year's natural disasters—may have originated in nature, the magnitude of its destruction is a man-made catastrophe. Consider the following:• Since the 1980s when AIDS first emerged, the United States has demanded “economic austerity measures” in impoverished countries. In Africa , these policies cut national health budgets in half just when public health systems needed to be ramped up to combat AIDS. Today, the pandemic is the single greatest obstacle to economic development in Africa .• To bolster already-huge profits of U.S. pharmaceutical companies, the Bush administration has blocked the sale of affordable generic drugs that have saved millions of lives in rich countries.• Women are made particularly vulnerable to HIV infection because they are denied the rights to refuse sex or insist on condom use. As the majority of those living in poverty and the poorest of the poor, women are more likely to contract HIV and more likely to develop symptoms of AIDS soon after they are infected.AIDS, unjust economic policies, and women's inequality are mutually reinforcing crises; combating any one of these requires addressing them together. But too often, public health programs, government policies, and even activists compartmentalize issues, missing critical points of inter-connection that are keys to effecting change.One reason for this myopia is that a singular focus on AIDS as a naturally occurring scourge allows policymakers to avoid tackling tough social issues like economic justice and gender equality. Take the relationship between AIDS and women's property rights in Kenya . Each year, hundreds of thousands of Kenyan women are widowed by AIDS. Because Kenyan laws and customs bar women from owning and inheriting property, women and their children are often forcibly displaced from their homes when their husbands die. Displacement increases women's risk of contracting HIV by exposing them to poverty, homelessness, violence, and disease, sometimes compelling them to trade sex for food and shelter. Protecting women's property rights is an urgent component of HIV/AIDS prevention strategies. But safeguarding these rights entails challenging law and tradition and spotlighting volatile issues related to land tenure and distribution of resources in an impoverished country.In fact, any successful prevention strategy has to promote women's social and economic rights. Yet the dominant approach remains the Bush administration's ill-conceived “ABC” strategy: “Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms.” Abstinence is not a choice for women who are raped or coerced into sex. Faithfulness is irrelevant for women whose husbands have multiple partners (for African women, marriage is actually a risk factor for contracting HIV). And condoms—presented by the Bush administration as a “last resort” in the fight against AIDS—depend on men's willingness to use them and both partner's willingness to forgo having children. Moreover, by placing the burden for prevention on individual behavior, the ABC strategy allows policymakers to ignore the poverty and inequality that form the breeding ground for AIDS.As 2005 draws to a close, it's clear that the UN's “3 by 5” initiative to provide anti-retroviral drugs to three million people by the end of the year will fail by a two-thirds margin. In Africa , nine out of ten people with HIV/AIDS are still denied these drugs, now almost universally available in wealthy countries. The reason? Lack of political will and high drug prices. Universal access to treatment is an achievable goal, but it requires the United States and EU to act at this month's World Trade Organization meeting to respect poor countries' right to import cheaper generic versions of AIDS drugs.Effective programs that combine HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention have been implemented in Uganda, Tanzania, Thailand, and elsewhere. But rather than support the best of these efforts, the Bush administration has put AIDS policy into the hands of Christian fundamentalists (who have pushed their ideological ABC approach to prevention) and drug-company lobbyists (who have prioritized industry profits over ensuring access to life-saving medicines). Today, the White House is issuing reminders of President Bush's “compassionate” $15 billion program to fight AIDS, particularly in Africa . But that promise was made over three years ago and most of the money has never materialized. In fact, Bush's initiative actually undermined effective international efforts to combat AIDS through the UN Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria. Instead of paying its fair share to the Fund ($3.5 billion, or one-third of the total), the United States has pledged just $0.6 billion for 2006-2007.This year's debt forgiveness offer by the G-8 (the world's richest countries) is yet another empty promise to African AIDS sufferers. It's widely assumed that money freed up by the deal will be used to fight AIDS, but no mechanism exists to make this happen. In fact, the deal still leaves most African countries spending four times more on debt servicing than on health and education—the most critical sectors in the fight against AIDS. Actually converting debt payments into AIDS funding would yield $15 billion a year—the precise amount that UNAIDS needs to fund its programs. We know that the World Bank and International Monetary Fund can afford to cancel 100 percent of poor countries' debt without much impact on their operations. But these institutions' largest shareholder, the United States, is opposed to unconditional debt cancellation. It's not really about the money, which is negligible in relation to the U.S. economy. Rather, the United States leverages the debt to ensure African governments' compliance with policies that suit U.S. interests.Last week, the United Nations released its annual report on the global AIDS crisis. It was mostly bad news, but it did credit aggressive prevention and treatment programs with reducing the adult HIV infection rate in Kenya from 10% to 7% between the late 1990s and 2003; and with lowering infection rates for pregnant women in Kenya from a staggering 28% to 9% during the same period.Rebecca Lolosoli knows first-hand the importance of combining treatment and prevention in the fight against AIDS. Two years ago, Rebecca began working with MADRE, an international women's human rights organization, to bring HIV/AIDS prevention educators to her community. “In our trainings with MADRE, we've learned that we have a right to demand medicine for the women in our community. But our best hope is to avoid HIV in the first place. For that, we women must have the right to say no without being forced or beaten. And women need to be able to own and inherit land so that we can feed ourselves and our children. This is how we can stay healthy. Changing traditional ways is not easy,” Rebecca says with a broad smile. “But it has many rewards.”

HIV/AIDS in Africa: Time to Stop the Killing FieldsKey PointsAfrica accounts for 70% of all HIV/AIDS cases in the world although it represents only 10% of the global population. More than 25 million Africans live with HIV/AIDS, and 17 million have already died.The response of the international community has been slow and largely ineffective.The UN estimates that Africa will need $3 billion just for basic treatment and prevention programs, yet the U.S. and other Western countries donated only $300 million in assistance in 2000.According to the UN Agency for HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), 25.3 million Africans live with the virus or are dying of AIDS. Barring a miracle or a major change in international attention to the scourge, these Africans will die within the next decade.Despite the horrors of the pandemic, the international response has been limited and only recently have most African governments begun to publicly address the problem. African governments are hobbled by poverty, cultural taboos about sex, and misperceptions about the cause and seriousness of AIDS. They also fear disruption of precious tourism and investment dollars from the West and have failed to warn their citizens about the dangers of AIDS. Western nations, including the U.S., have largely ignored the dangers and international repercussions of widespread infection in Africa. The United States in 2000 spent only $300 million for basic AIDS care and prevention programs in Africa—far short of the $3 billion regarded as necessary to slow down the pandemic.The HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa is of the gravest magnitude. Every day, 6,700 families lose a loved one to the disease; the construction and sale of coffins is one of the fastest growing occupations in southern Africa. Sixteen African countries have one-tenth or more of their population infected with HIV, and Africa is home to 95% of all mother-to-child transmissions of HIV. In these countries, almost 80% of all deaths of young adults aged 25-45 will be directly linked to AIDS.In six countries of southern Africa, by the year 2005, AIDS will claim the lives of between 8 and 25% of today’s active physicians. Women are affected more by this dreaded disease; in Africa, 12 women have HIV/AIDS for every 10 men. African women account for 85% of all global female infections. In southern Africa, one in four women aged 15-49 live with HIV/AIDS. In some countries, between 10 and 20% of teen-age girls are already infected. Infected girls are more likely than boys to drop out of school, reversing decades of slow but steady progress in female education. The much-vaunted African extended family system is faltering, as the number of orphans living without the care of extended families rises. By the year 2010, the projected number of orphans may exceed 40 million in Africa.Africa’s hard-won health and education gains in the 1960s and 1970s were undermined by debt and by externally dictated structural adjustment policies in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, however, social services and economies are imploding from the deadly consequences of AIDS. In the coming decades, the continent will record significantly sharper declines in life expectancy rates and shrinkage of national economies from the effects of the epidemic.Africans living with HIV/AIDS have limited or no access to lifesaving anti-retroviral medicines that have changed the course and management of AIDS in Western countries. Less than one-tenth of one percent of Africans living with AIDS have access to AIDS drugs. The World Bank estimates that half of all Africans live on $0.65 cents per day. The economic resources of African governments are equally meager, and they are burdened by $20 billion in annual foreign debt payments. With the rudimentary healthcare infrastructure of African countries, the strain of long-term hospitalization of AIDS patients is taking a heavy toll.Economic underdevelopment and Africa’s impoverished conditions have created a wide-open gateway for HIV infection, tuberculosis (TB), and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 30-50% of all TB patients in Africa are also infected with HIV/AIDS. Africa has the highest rates of STDs in the world. STDs facilitate the spread of HIV infection, especially among women.Political instability and violent conflicts keep many African governments from focusing on the AIDS crisis. Twenty of the continent’s 53 countries are involved in intrastate or interstate conflicts, which lead to having the world’s largest regional concentration of refugees. Another important factor in the deepening crisis is the high rate of AIDS within Africa’s armed forces—15-20% of the members of the military in some countries have AIDS. Mobility of the African male populations—through military operations, migrant labor such as mine workers, and shifts from rural to urban centers—exacerbates the spread of HIV/AIDS. As the HIV/AIDS pandemic continues, political and social instability will likely intensify as AIDS gobbles up scarce human and economic resources. Problems with Current U.S. PolicyKey ProblemsThe U.S. has not provided global leadership on access to AIDS drugs for Africa and has not supported Africa?s demand to purchase or produce generic drugs.The U.S. 2001 budget for fighting AIDS in Africa is about $460 million, but much more is needed.The U.S. has yet to assert its influence at the World Bank and the IMF to put more resources in Africa and to cancel external debts.Whether someone lives or dies of AIDS depends largely on where she or he lives. Despite the availability of drugs to treat AIDS, millions of Africans will die because they do not have access to AIDS drugs. In the U.S. and other Western nations, such drugs have helped AIDS to become a disease that can be managed and for which effective care is available.Confronting the AIDS emergency, African governments are demanding that pharmaceutical companies directly provide AIDS drugs at deep discounts, or at the very least not oppose compulsory licensing and parallel import arrangements. Compulsory licensing is an international trade mechanism by which countries can instruct a patent holder to license the right to use this patent to any national company or government agency. Parallel importing describes a practice whereby a country imports goods for resale without authorization from the original seller. (See Robert Weissman, “Facilitating Access to Essential Medicines,” FPIF, February 2001.) This struggle became heated with the court battle between the government of South Africa and 39 drug companies. The companies contended that a new law would allow the South African government to ignore international patent law.Under mounting international pressure, the pharmaceutical industry dropped its suit, and has promised to facilitate the flow of low-priced AIDS-treatment pharmaceuticals. But this issue will not go away, because even lower priced drugs will still be out of reach for most Africans, and the pharmaceutical industry remains committed to strong international patent protection and to staving off the production of generic medicines for the treatment of AIDS and other illnesses.The U.S and its Western allies have failed to provide significant funds to fight AIDS in Africa. In 2001, the wealthiest nation on earth is spending only $460 million dollars to fight the biggest medical and humanitarian emergency of our time. The United Nations estimates that at least $10 billion will be needed to fight AIDS in Africa. A group of Harvard researchers, economists, and scientists recommended that, at bare minimum, the U.S. should spend $1.5 billion a year to fight AIDS in Africa.Fortunately, U.S. policymakers are responding to such public pressure with increased allocations. The U.S. Senate, for example, recently approved a $700 million increase in proposed spending over the next two years to fight AIDS in poor countries. However, much more needs to be done.In another major issue confronting Africa, U.S policymakers have not squared up to their responsibility. Africa owes foreign banks and governments about $350 billion. These debts are controversial and a major hindrance to an adequate African response to AIDS. Every year, Africa spends roughly $20 billion on debt repayment—more than the combined continental outlay for healthcare and education. At least 23 African countries spend more money on debt repayment than they spend for healthcare. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank have yet to effect significant debt cancellation for African nations despite widespread pressure from international citizen movements and from the G8, the forum of the world’s wealthiest nations. The U.S., which is the largest shareholder in these two international financial institutions, has yet to demand debt cancellation for Africa.The policy problems that contribute to the AIDS crisis in Africa extend beyond Washington and other international donors. Until recently, African leaders have largely ignored the pandemic. Even today, very few African nations match their AIDS rhetoric with commensurate budget allocations. Uganda and Senegal are prominent exceptions.Senegal, through a combination of political will, prudent budget allocations, and massive mobilization has kept its rate of infection to less than one percent. Ugandan President Yoweri Musuveni, recognizing the gravity of the AIDS pandemic, mobilized his people to modify risky behaviors and to come forward for testing and counseling. The rate of AIDS in Uganda is down to about 8%, from a high of 16% in the early 1990s.Despite the laudable efforts of Uganda and Senegal, corruption and the squandering of scarce national resources continue. Government spending on wars, white elephant projects, and persecution of political and economic opponents is still rife across the continent. Toward a New Foreign PolicyKey RecommendationsThe U.S should lead other rich nations in supplying essential medicines to Africans living with AIDS, and devote significantly more resources to fighting AIDS in Africa.The U.S should lead the fight for debt relief for African nations and ensure that the savings go into AIDS relief and other healthcare programs.The U.S and other rich nations should work with African governments to create an environment conducive to AIDS relief on the continent.The immediate goal of a reinvigorated U.S policy should be the dismantling of all legal and logistic obstacles to the provision of affordable drugs to all Africans living with AIDS. The developed nations, led by the U.S., should rise in unison and make a simple pledge: No African Man, Woman, Child, or Infant Should Be Denied Access to Lifesaving AIDS Drugs, by December 2002.As the leading global democracy, the U.S. should democratize access to essential AIDS medicines for poor nations. We commend the Bush administration for maintaining President Clinton’s executive order on flexible access to AIDS drugs for poor nations. However, the U.S. needs to do more. The U.S. should ensure that the World Trade Organization (WTO) implements a flexible interpretation of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS), thereby allowing poor nations facing the AIDS emergency to provide cheap AIDS drugs to their citizens. The U.S. and its allies should also ensure that all WTO rulings reflect a sound public health framework to ensure that the goal of unencumbered trade does not create adverse health consequences in poor nations.The U.S. government should work more closely with the pharmaceutical companies to ensure that all obstacles to speedy and effective delivery of AIDS medicines to poor nations are eliminated. These obstacles include: (1) the concerns of pharmaceutical companies about possible parallel imports of cheap AIDS drugs into the lucrative Western markets by poor nations; (2) the concerns of citizen advocates and AIDS activists that access to AIDS drugs should not come under the purview of market forces and restrictive patent laws; and, (3) the concerns of African governments that they should have the exclusive prerogative to determine national emergencies and possible remedial actions. Washington should also work to persuade U.S. multinational companies doing business in Africa to provide AIDS prevention and treatment programs for their workers and family members.The U.S. should devote more resources to fighting AIDS in Africa. America has always responded to major humanitarian needs, whether in Europe, Asia, or Latin America. It is time to spend readily available resources to stop AIDS in Africa. Harvard researchers estimated that a scaled-up U.S. response of $1.5 billion would cost about $5 a year per American. Doubling such a commitment would cost each American about $10 a year—a commitment well worth making, considering the magnitude of the crisis and its long-term implications for global peace and development.It is not likely that other rich nations will spend significantly more money on AIDS without a serious commitment from the United States. The Constituency for Africa (CFA), under the leadership of former Congressman Ron Dellums, proposed a HIV/AIDS Marshall Plan for Africa with significant public- and private-sector funds to fight the disease. As a result, Congress, in August 2000, passed Public Law 106-264, the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000, sponsored by Jim Leach, R-Iowa and Barbara Lee, D-California, that earmarked $150 million dollars for each of the fiscal years 2001 and 2002, for a Trust Fund. The Trust Fund will be used to leverage funds from multilateral development banks like the World Bank and to encourage similar commitments from other Western donors. The Trust Fund will also fund the implementation of specific HIV/AIDS programs in Africa. President Clinton signed the bill into law, as a modest start to what promises to be a long journey.The U.S. should use its significant leverage in the G8, the IMF, and the World Bank to provide debt relief for African nations. The U.S. has the excellent opportunity at the G8 summit, in July 2001, to persuade its allies to forgive the debt of African nations, on the condition that African governments plow back such savings into verifiable investments in AIDS prevention and treatment programs and other healthcare services. The U.S. government is not the major holder of African debt—it is owed about $360 million out of the estimated $350 billion in controversial debts—but the U.S. has the moral, economic, and political leverage to advance a genuine debt relief agenda among its allies. Washington should also work with African leaders and their peoples to ensure a concerted and consistent focus on the AIDS epidemic. Without dictating their actions, the U.S should work with African governments to ensure movement in the following areas: (1) allocation of more money by African nations to fight AIDS; (2) sustained political reforms to encourage pluralistic political and multi-sector campaigns against AIDS; (3) end corrupt practices that siphon foreign aid and investments; and, (4) encourage the emergence of more civil society involvement in politics and non-government programs at community levels.The international community led by the U.S. should not turn its back on 25 million Africans living under a death sentence. The international cooperation that has fought against oppression and tyranny since World War II should not permit the AIDS killing fields to continue in Africa. A strong case can be made that the AIDS pandemic in Africa represents a direct threat to U.S. national interests and national security because of associated political instability, economic downturn, and the intercontinental spread of infectious diseases. In the end, however, U.S. citizens and U.S. policymakers face a moral imperative and should ask: Have we done all we can to save 25 million fellow human beings from an avoidable death?

The Dis-Integration of U.S. Global AIDS FundingIn his proposed "Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief" announced during last month's State of the Union Address, President Bush promised, among other things, "a comprehensive plan [to] prevent seven million new HIV infections." International organizations working to prevent the spread of HIV and improve women's health worldwide met the announcement with a mixture of hope and skepticism. Hope because prevention is critical to reducing the toll of HIV worldwide. Skepticism because sound AIDS prevention depends on effective promotion of safe sex, an obvious area of contention for the Bush administration.Unprotected heterosexual sex is the leading factor in HIV transmission throughout the world today. Women now represent half of those infected with HIV worldwide, and 58% of those infected in sub-Saharan Africa, the region most severely affected by the AIDS epidemic to date. Moreover, in many countries, including India and other parts of Asia, new infections are rising rapidly among married women and adolescent girls. High rates of sexual violence and coercion by husbands and intimate partners, discriminatory cultural practices such as child marriage and dowry, and economic dependence on men leave even monogamous married women increasingly vulnerable to both unsafe sex and to infection due to the behavior of their husbands.These same conditions also result in high rates of unintended pregnancy. It is a fundamental reality that women are uniquely at risk of HIV infection and pregnancy in every single act of unprotected intercourse, illustrating the urgent need to simultaneously address the realities of sex, power, and reproduction. Common sense and field experience suggests the best approach is to invest heavily in integrated HIV and family programs that offer a range of services, including efforts to increase access to and use of male and female condoms and other contraceptive methods; training in partner communication and negotiation; access to voluntary counseling and testing; and programs to address sexual violence and coercion, among other things. As noted by the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Sector Strategy for HIV/AIDS, existing family planning programs "provide a clear entry point for the delivery of HIV/AIDS interventions" critical to slowing the spread of HIV, and reducing unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions worldwide. WHO, the World Bank, the European Union, and until recently, USAID, all strongly support integrated prevention strategies.Given this reality, the President's new AIDS plan immediately raised an obvious question. Could an administration reflexively opposed to any kind of reproductive health services embrace a sound public health strategy in response to the inextricably linked problems of unprotected sex, unintended pregnancy, and infection? The answer: Apparently not.For the past two years, President Bush has been waging what can only be called a religious war on sexual and reproductive health programs both at home and abroad, undercutting the very foundations on which prevention strategies are built. He began this crusade by reneging on the U.S. contribution to the United Nations Population Program. Since then, State Department operatives tried--and failed--to undermine a global consensus on the need for universal access to reproductive health services. The President is slashing funds for sex education and family planning while touting unproven "only-abstinence" strategies domestically and internationally. He is replacing scientific and medical information in the public domain with unsubstantiated findings on condoms and abortion cooked up by the far right. And he regularly panders to groups that define both IUDs and contraceptive pills as "abortifacients" and refer to HIV as a "gay plague." The list goes on.In listening to the President's new religion on HIV, a healthy dose of skepticism therefore seemed warranted. Even so, initial indications were promising. The President's plan appeared to dramatically increase funding for global AIDS programs, and to acknowledge the need for sound prevention strategies by virtue of inclusion in the ensuing press releases of the word "condoms." Soon, however, reality set in. The promised $15 billion ($10 billion in new money) for international HIV/AIDS programs evaporated in a cloud of double- and triple-counting of funds already appropriated, and of contributions deferred far into the future. If the President's plan is adopted, the U.S. will annually contribute less than a third of the amount estimated by the international community to be our fair share in the fight against AIDS, and our contribution to the Global Fund will be all but eliminated.Now comes the announcement last week by the administration that U.S. funding for global HIV programs will be saddled by ideologically driven restrictions aimed at separating "family planning" from "HIV prevention" in developing countries. The so-called Mexico City policy or "global gag rule" will now be applied to all integrated family planning and HIV prevention programs. This policy denies funding to any international organization that, in addition to routine contraceptive and other essential reproductive health services, performs abortions in countries where they are legal (like, say, the United States), collects data on, provides referrals for abortion services, or advocates for changes in laws regulating abortion (which, thanks to the First Amendment, still includes the United States). Seeing an abortion behind every clinic wall, but clearly just opposed to family planning generally, the administration has now decided to apply these restrictions wholesale to integrated HIV and family planning programs.The State Department and USAID have been scrambling to write guidance for this convoluted policy. An internal memo, noting that, "comprehensive HIV/AIDS programs usually contain some family planning" indicates that the policy "would apply to foreign NGOs implementing U.S. funded family planning within HIV/AIDS programs." In other words, programs will be forced to play "this little condom goes to HIV prevention, and this little condom goes to pregnancy prevention (or not)." Never mind that HIV-infected sperm don't make such distinctions.This policy is the clearest evidence yet that the administration is against family planning and contraception, period. The draft guidance says that organizations that have signed the Mexico City Policy (MCP) "will still be able to receive HIV/AIDS funding, as long as none of the funds are diverted to family planning [and] NGOs that don't accept MCP can accept HIV funds, provided they don't engage in family planning activities or abortion as part of U.S. funded health programs." This is, in effect, an expansion of the existing policy.The most immediate victims of this new assault will be women and children for whom integrated services often make the difference between life and death. Hundreds of millions of women in every region of the world rely heavily on family planning programs for a range of services for which there are no alternatives. For women at risk, these programs are the best entry point for information on prevention. For women who are already or suspect they may be infected, integrated services provide confidential outlets for voluntary counseling and testing, drugs to prevent maternal-to-child transmission (MTCT), and accurate information on sensitive issues, such as whether HIV-positive mothers can safely breastfeed infants. They provide a source of care free from the stigma often associated with stand-alone HIV prevention programs. They also offer HIV-infected women access to contraceptive information and supplies, enabling them to exercise their fundamental right to decide whether and when to bear children.Now, service providers will have to refrain from counseling family planning clients on how to practice safe sex to avoid infection. They won't be able to help infected women prevent an unintended pregnancy. The President appears unable or unwilling to grasp the fact that women seeking contraceptive information and supplies are sexually active and therefore by definition at risk of infection from unprotected sex, and that HIV-infected women may remain sexually active and at risk of unintended pregnancy. What is more, he clearly has no idea of the realities of women's lives in settings in which violence, discrimination, and lack of access to the most basic forms of information and care are the norm.These restrictions are morally and ethically indefensible and contradict basic principles of public health, human rights, and economic efficiency. If the President seriously believes that the U.S. has "a calling to make this world better" he should devise an HIV/AIDS initiative in which actions speak louder than words.

Pipeline patents, compulsory licensing and the costs of AIDS treatment in BrazilPaula Martini More than 200,000 HIV positive people receive anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs) at no cost from the Brazilian government. However, the sustainability of this AIDS Programme is being threatened by the high prices of the patent protected medicines: the universal distribution policy costs the Health Ministry about US$1 billion per year – 80 percent of which is spent only on six out of the 18 ARV medicines provided by the program.The six drugs in question – lopinavir/ritonavir, abacavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, amprenavir and efavirenz – had their Brazilian patents claimed in 1996 via the country-exclusive mechanism known as the "pipeline", a temporary institute created by articles 230 and 231 of the Brazilian Industrial Property Law (9.279/96) that resulted in the filing of 1,182 patents, many of which were products already in the public domain prior to 1996.Prior to the amendment, products like food and pharmaceuticals could not have their patents filed in Brazil. The 1996 law went much further than the plain suppression of that prohibition (which was actually required for the implementation of the 1994 WTO's TRIPS Agreement): it allowed all patent claims for those products – previously requested in any other country – to be automatically approved and granted in Brazil, as long as the object had not been comercialized in any market yet, and that any efforts to explore it had taken place in the country.The interested parties had one year to formalize the patent at the Brazilian patent office, the National Institute of Industrial Property (INPI), and only had to prove the original filing was made elsewhere. Still, according to the law, those patents would even skip the traditional INPI's previous evaluation. "The impact was the creation of monopolies that had a huge impact on prices", says Michel Lotrowska, Brazil's representative of the campaign on access to essential medicines led by the NGO Médecins Sans Frontières.As a result, the country's novelty requirement was also neglected in the pipeline mechanism, even though the TRIPS' Article 27, paragraph 1 stated that "any inventions, whether products or processes, in all fields of technology, provided that they are new (...)" are patentable. This becomes a bigger issue when the 1988 Brazilian Federal Constitution adopted a principle of absolute novelty for industrial property, i.e., if the protection-claimed technology already became public prior to the patent filing date, no temporary monopoly privilege can exist.Compulsory licensing: does it actually hurt innovation?Brazil is one of the ten biggest pharmaceuticals market in the world. The universal access to treatment, granted by the 1988 Federal Constitution, creates a broad and reliable market for the transnational pharmaceutical industry, as well as a unique and special client: the government.But sometimes customer's old dissatisfaction can spill over. In May 2007, one of the six ARVs of the AIDS program licensed under the pipeline mechanism was compulsorily licensed by the Brazilian government in an historical decision: efavirenz had its public interest declared by the President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva after Merck refused to reduce its price from US$1.57 a patient/day to the 65 cents at which it is sold to Thailand. Efavirenz's first patent claim was filed in 1992, i.e., had the pipeline patent not been granted, this active ingredient would be in the public domain and could have been produced generically in Brazil, as it has been in India. So, from May 2007 on, efavirenz is being bought from Indian laboratories, and royalties of 1,5 percent over the amount invested by government on the drug purchasing are being paid to Merck – that remain the patent owner.A compulsory license is legal under the TRIPS Agreement, Article 31, if: "prior to such use, the proposed user has made efforts to obtain authorization from the rights-holder on reasonable commercial terms and conditions and such efforts have not been successful within a reasonable period of time". But the same article also states that this requirement may be waived in cases of "national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency or in cases of public non-commercial use". In 2001, the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health also reinforced countries' liberties to decide when public health concerns come before intellectual property rights.The pharmaceutical industry often argues that compulsory licensing hurts innovation due to the high investments required for research and development (R&amp;D). Renata Reis, coordinator of the Working Group on Intellectual Property (GTPI) from the Brazilian Network for the Integration of Peoples (REBRIP), says: "R&amp;D substantial investments are not made in the South countries. Usually the medicine is an adaptation, for local conditions, of the already existing medicine. Besides that, industry tends to include marketing costs in its R&amp;D budgets, as James Love reported in a 1993 document by the CPTech".An article published in the Berkeley Technology Law Journal compares rates of patenting and other measures of inventive activity before and after compulsory licenses over drug patents, suggesting that "the assertion that licensing categorically harms innovation is probably wrong".TRIPS Agreement and production of generic drugsSince the TRIPS Agreement signing by the WTO's Member States, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been alerting countries about the need for monitoring the implications of this and other international treaties on the enforcement of access to medicines policies.At the time of the signing, developing countries that did not recognize patents for pharmaceuticals (like India and Brazil) had the option to only do so after a 10-year transition period, a flexibility foreseen in the TRIPS Agreement. Under pressure, Brazil decided to start recognizing patents immediately (from 1997 on), while India chose to do so only in 2005. That allowed Indian local industry to develop and export not only generic versions of many medicines that are patent-protected in most countries, but also to develop new combinations in fixed doses of patented ARVs, which can facilitate adhesion to the treatment due to a reduced number of pills to be ingested.Countries like Brazil and Thailand could only structure their AIDS programmes because the main ARV medicines were not protected by patents and could be cheaply imported and/or locally produced. And the success of the Brazilian programme derived complimentary concerns, as Renata Reis says: "The survival rate is very high here, so access to new second-line therapy drugs has critical importance for keeping HIV infection under control by overcoming the long-term patient's growing resistance to the ARV previous treatments".The prices of the second-line ARVs threaten the sustainability of Brazilian universal drugs distribution policy, since they cannot be locally manufactured as generics. Though the country has got full capacity and ability to produce the second-line ARV medicines, as attested by the document "ARVs Production in Brazil - An Evaluation", by Professors Joseph M. Fortunak and Octavio A. C. Antunes – indeed, until the 1990s, Brazil had national production of ARVs, a process prematurely interrupted by the pipeline mechanism.

3 things you need to know about biofuelsWhy care about liquid fuel?There’s a reason we use different forms of energy to do different jobs, and it’s not because we’re all just that fickle. Instead, we’ve made these decisions based on some combination of what has (historically, anyway) given us the best results, what is safest, what is most efficient, and what costs us the least money.In a nutshell, that’s why liquid fuel is so valuable. So far, it’s the clear winner when we need energy for transportation—especially air transportation and heavy, long-distance shipping—because it allows you to stuff a lot of energy into relatively small amount of storage space, and easily refill on the go. There are other options, of course, like electricity. And that can work quite well, depending on what you’re trying to do. Eventually, we may find ourselves in a world where liquid fuel is no longer the best option. But we aren’t there yet. And for those forms of transport that take us into the air or move our belongings very long distances, we aren't likely to get there for a good long time.That's why I care about liquid fuel, and why I'm interested in the future of biofuels. Yes, biofuels do have a future. But what that future will be depends on whether we can control for some very messy variables. Here, in three points, are the big things you need to know about biofuel.1. Corn ethanol really is flawed. But maybe not as much as you think.Biofuel is a nice, round word encompassing a lot of tricky, little, oddly shaped dots. You can make biofuel from lots of different things, in lots of different ways. Corn ethanol, cellulosic ethanol, bio-oil, bio-diesel, algae oil—they all have some benefits and some detriments, which means they all have some big backers and some big haters. Right now, any biofuel produced at a big, commercially useful scale is bound to be ethanol, and in the United Sates, that means corn ethanol. But, from what I see, the evidence favors using options that aren’t dependent on a dedicated corn crop. That’s not to say that corn ethanol is the devil—its bad reputation comes, at least in part, from backlash against some pretty heinous overselling—but it does have some big drawbacks and we might have an easier time making truly Green biofuels another way.Part of this stems from corn’s big appetite for inputs, like fertilizer. Those inputs represent energy spent, and energy spent is (in today’s world) greenhouse gas emissions produced. The more energy you have to spend on producing a biofuel—from making fertilizer and running the tractor for annual replanting, to powering the fuel production process and shipping fuel to the gas station—the less benefit you actually end up with at the end. There are lots of different ways to tally those numbers up, but Argonne National Laboratory has one of the best calculators around. Called GREET—a perky, welcoming acronym for The Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation Model—it’s a software program that adds up all the different ways energy is used and greenhouse gases are emitted over the life of a fuel, and runs simulations based on variables like geographic location, types of farming methods, and types of fuel production methods.GREET figures that corn ethanol really can be better than gasoline. You can get more energy out of a gallon of corn ethanol than you used to make it. And a gallon of corn ethanol can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by somewhere between 18% and 28%, compared to a gallon of gasoline.But here comes our friend, the yesbut. Yes, you can get an emissions benefit from corn ethanol. But, this only works if the ethanol plant is powered by natural gas. If it runs on coal, you’re not reducing emissions at all.Also: The picture only looks this rosy when you compare corn ethanol to gasoline, but not to any of the other competing biofuels. A 28% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions sounds fabulous, until you look at cellulosic biofuels—made from things like grass, stems, wood chips, and trash paper. There’s lots of different ways to make cellulosic biofuels, including a cellulosic version of ethanol, and they reduce emissions by a whopping 82%-to-87%. Nobody is producing them at scale yet, but in a world of limited time and resources, cellulosic biofuels look like a better bang for our buck. Plus, you get some ancillary benefits from the plants that make cellulosics that corn can't match, including improvements to soil quality, and reduction of erosion.2. We can screw up cellulosic biofuel, too.It’s important that I don’t give cellulosic biofuels the used-car lot megaphone treatment that corn ethanol received. They’re better, not perfect, and a lot of the research being done on cellulosic biofuels is focused on figuring out how to not screw them up. They could still backfire spectacularly—driving up food prices, dumping more fertilizer into the Mississippi, or even increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. To keep that from happening, scientists say we have to pay a lot of attention to what’s being grown, and where.For instance, in the Midwest, it’s likely the best biofuel crop won’t be a single crop at all. David Tilman, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota and winner of the 2008 International Prize for Biology, has been studying prairie plant biofuels for more than a decade.Out on the prairie, Tilman and his team found significant problems with growing a field of nothing but switch grass. By its lonesome, the grass grows in the sickly, patchy style of a 15-year-old’s goatee—creating a temptation to douse it in fertilizer. After seven years, Tilman said, it usually needs to be plowed under and planted again. But when the team planted a mix of four native grasses and four native legumes—think alfalfa or clover—the results were very different. Together, the plants grew in a thick mass and didn’t need to be re-seeded or fertilized. After 10 years, Tilman found these mixtures were producing 238 percent more energy, every year, than any one plant grown alone. They also made the soil more fertile, naturally increasing levels of nitrogen and phosphorous. “It makes sense,” Tilman said. “It’s a mixture of prairie plants that made that soil to begin with.”But even the most well-meaning, soil-enriching mix of plants has to deal with the problem of land-use change.3. Land use matters. But there's still a lot we don't know about that.Direct land-use change is easy to wrap one’s head around. Say you own an acre of timber and you decide to clear it, because you can get a good price for growing biofuel crops there, instead. That timber was locking in a lot of carbon in the form of trees, and plants, and virgin soil. Depending on what happens to the trees, and how you treat that soil, you can end up inadvertently releasing a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Enough to affect the net emissions of the biofuel crop you grow there later.Indirect land-use change is a little more thorny. The world, as they say, is flat. An acre of corn or wheat grown in the United States isn’t merely used to fatten American cattle or bake American bread. We participate in a global food market and what we do here has consequences abroad. So, if a farmer in the Midwest decides that she’s going to take an acre of corn and replant it with a prairie grass and legume mix for biofuel, what happens?Some experts are worried it would lead to an decrease in availability of corn, which would lead to a rise in the price of corn, and a farmer in some other part of the world, or even just another part of the U.S., deciding that he’s going to capture that cash benefit by taking an acre of timber and turning it into an acre of corn. Or, just as bad, that the price increase would lead someone, somewhere, to go hungry.At first glance, that logic sounds foolproof. And most researchers agree that it has to be taken into account and studied as we plan the future of energy. But, when you ask how big an impact land—use change might have—that’s when the experts start to disagree.There are some researchers who think land-use change basically negates the usefulness of all but a tiny portion of biofuels that come from certain farm, industrial, and municipal wastes. There are others who think that it won’t really be a problem. Based on the majority of scientists I've spoken with and the research I've read, I think the reality lies somewhere in between, and that there’s a good chance cellulosic fuels can skirt the issue if they’re done the way people like David Tilman have proposed.At the heart of this debate: How well the computer models used to predict land-use change reflect reality. A model is only as accurate as the assumptions that go into it, and critics say that the worst-case-scenarios are based on some pretty faulty assumptions. First, there’s the assumption that increased demand for a crop like corn will inevitably lead to deforestation, or plowing under previously wild land. But in the United States, as well as overseas, there’s a surprising amount of previously cleared land that isn’t being used to grow much of anything, either because farmers have been paid a subsidy to leave it fallow, or because the land turned out to be no good for annual row crops, or, as is common in developing countries like Brazil, because cleared land is owned land—even if you’re just keeping one cow on it.“We’re only using between half and a fourth of all previously cleared forest land on Earth for crop production in any given year,” says Keith Kline, a global change and developing countries analyst with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.Kline, who worked in developing countries for 22 years studying and promoting biodiversity, is one of several scientists I spoke with who said that—contrary to some land-use change models—deforestation is not about crop prices. At least, not solely. Social and cultural factors—like the desire to own land you can get for free just by clearing it—are equally important. You can’t assume that a rise in global crop prices will naturally lead to an increase in deforestation, or that deforestation would stop if crop prices stayed the same or went down. In fact, according to Kline, the highest rates of deforestation worldwide happened in the 1990s, before the ethanol boom in the U.S. and at a time when food commodity prices were consistently low. And deforestation rates have been falling ever since.The second bad assumption the worst-case models make is that the same amount of land can’t grow more crops. Perennial mixes for cellulosic biofuels could actually be grown alongside row crops, or on the same land, between the harvest and next planting, Tilman told me. At the same time, crop yields—the amount of useable stuff you can grow without increasing the square footage—have consistently gone up, every year, in the United States. That happens in small increments today, but there’s plenty of room for yields to improve dramatically overseas. The productivity of what you do with the crops can also increase. For instance, most corn is actually used for feeding livestock, not people. But less corn being available doesn’t necessarily mean people eat less meat. Instead, they might just switch the kind of meat they eat. It takes about 10x as much corn to grow a pound of beef as it takes to grow a pound of chicken.Finally, some predictions in the worst-case models don’t match up with what we’ve seen in the real-world. They assume corn exports will go down, as U.S. ethanol production rises, leading to those higher global prices that theoretically inspire deforestation to begin with. But that’s not what happened. Instead, in 2007, as corn ethanol production in America hit 6 billion gallons, corn exports rose by 14 percent, compared to the previous year. In fact, they’ve been, generally, trending on the rise since 2003.

Brazil &amp; climate change: a country profileSummaryBrazil plays an important and unique role in climate change. It is one of the ten largest economies in the world and — most importantly for climate change — home to one of the greatest ecosystems and forests of the planet: the Amazon. Brazil is the eighth largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and the third largest emitter in the developing world after China and India, according to 2000 World Resources Institute figures. Unlike most developed and many developing countries, Brazil's energy sector contributes little to the country's greenhouse gas emissions. Unsustainable land use and forestry contribute most.Brazil's track record in renewable energies is an example to many. Brazil is the world's largest producer and also consumer of ethanol, which it has added to gasoline since the 1970s. This has reduced both greenhouse gas emissions and pollution in urban centres, where more that 80 per cent of the 180 million Brazilians live.In international negotiations, Brazil points out that climate change is driven more by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere than by yearly emissions, primarily because the most important greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) remains in the atmosphere for more than a century on average. Yearly emissions data therefore generally overestimate developing countries' contributions to climate change, and underestimate that of developed countries. Brazil therefore says that it will not limit its greenhouse gas emissions until the middle of the century.Brazil's vulnerability to climate changeBrazil is vulnerable to climate change, not least due to its fragile, biologically diverse ecosystems.  The tropical rain forest in the Amazon and the Pantanal wetland are of particular concern. Some studies show that, as temperatures rise, the Amazon rain forest could become dryer, making spontaneous fires more frequent. Those fires would release more greenhouse gases increasing their concentrations in the atmosphere, in turn raising temperatures further. There is also concern that coral reefs along Brazilian coastlines could suffer from the effects of climate change.Changing rainfall patterns, especially in the drought-affected northeastern region of the country, will mean poorer water resources and a reduced water supply. Agriculture will suffer, aggravating the risk of famines. Less rain will also affect the hydropower supply, which, according to the International Energy Association, provides more than 80 per cent of the electricity Brazil generates. Floods, which are already a serious problem for various regions, may increase. Coastal areas, where the bulk of the population and economic activities are concentrated, will be vulnerable to rising sea levels.How climate change will affect agricultural productivity is not yet understood in detail.  But possible effects on crops that are particularly important to the country's economy, such as corn, soybean, wheat, coffee and oranges, are a great concern.Finally, rising temperatures are expected to help organisms that act as vectors for diseases, such as mosquitoes, which transmit dengue fever and malaria, and assassin bugs (Tripanosomiasis americana), which transmit Chagas disease.Brazil has yet to undertake a comprehensive study of how climate change will affect its economy, society, agriculture, health and environment. It is important that Brazil completes such a vulnerability assessment in order to support policy decisions on how to adapt to the inevitable impacts of climate change.Emissions profileThe Brazilian emissions profile differs from developed countries, where burning fossil fuels for energy and transportation contribute most to overall emissions. In 1994, only 17 per cent of Brazil's total emissions came from energy production. Emissions from agriculture, land use and forestry, however, were together responsible for 81 per cent.About 38 per cent of the country's energy supply is generated from renewable sources, most importantly from large hydropower stations, which are responsible for 13 per cent, followed by sugarcane and wood (12 per cent each). As a result, energy emissions per person are relatively low (0.50 tons of carbon per person compared to 5.58 in the United States). But Brazil's emissions are fairly high for its overall economic activity because the sectors that contribute most to the economy, including iron and steel, cement, aluminium, chemical, petrochemical, pulp and paper, and transportation, rely heavily on fossil fuels which produce large amounts of greenhouse gases.The primary source of greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil is deforestation as agricultural frontiers expand, mainly in the Amazon region. In climate change policy jargon, this is referred to as 'land use, land use change, and forestry' (or LULUCF) emissions.Deforestation contributes to climate change first when forests are burnt, releasing greenhouse gases. Burning is widely used in the Amazon region to prepare new agricultural land. When forests are cleared, carbon that was held in the soil is also released as carbon dioxide or methane. Natural decomposition within intact forest is a further source of carbon dioxide and methane emissions.Good estimates of how much land has been deforested are available from satellite images. But the corresponding emissions are very hard to calculate, because of a lack of reliable data on how much biomass the different kinds of forests and savannahs hold.Demand for wood drives deforestation, as does the demand for land for large soybean plantations and extensive cattle rearing. Significant institutional gaps, especially between legislative power and law enforcing authorities, makes enforcing environmental laws in the Amazon region very difficult.In Brazil, emissions from raising cattle are as important as energy sector emissions. Farm animals release methane, and according to the Ministry of Science and Technology, in 1995 these emissions were in the order of ten megatonnes, 80 per cent of which came from beef cattle. Converted to carbon dioxide equivalent, that is equal to 233.7 megatonnes — only slightly lower than the 248.4 megatonnes of greenhouse gases emitted by the energy sector the previous year. Nitrous oxide is the second important gas emitted by agricultural activities, and accounts for nearly 150 megatonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. This brings the total emissions from the agricultural sector to just less than 383 megatonnes — one and a half times what is emitted by the entire energy sector.Government action: Brazilian efforts to lower emissionsBrazil has implemented many programmes where the primary objective was not to limit greenhouse gas emissions, but this has happened as a 'side-effect'. They include the ethanol and PROCEL programmes. Other programmes, such as the PROINFA and the biodiesel projects, were created with the express intention of reducing emissions.The Brazilian ethanol programmeThe Brazilian ethanol programme was first launched in 1975, when international sugar prices tumbled, and the oil bill of 1973 had increased the country's financial burden. The programme remains the largest commercial application of biomass for producing and using energy in the world. It succeeded in demonstrating the technical feasibility of large-scale ethanol production from sugarcane, and its use as a fuel for cars.The ethanol programme helped curb the increase of air pollution in Brazilian cities and reduce the greenhouse effect. In 1997, Isaías Macedo of the University of Campinas (Unicamp) showed that using sugarcane ethanol and bagasse (the dry pulpy residue left after extracting juice from sugar cane) had avoided the emission of 9.45 megatonnes of carbon in one year (1990–1991). The carbon that is released into the atmosphere when bagasse and ethanol are consumed for fuel is compensated by an equivalent quantity of carbon that the sugarcane absorbs during its growth. Taking into account only the gasoline that is not burned, using ethanol has avoided the release of 5.86 megatonnes of carbon per year between 1980 and 1990.The PROCEL (Electrical Energy Conservation Program)PROCEL was created in December 1985 to reduce the waste of electrical power on both the supply and the consumer side.In 1999, Emilio La Rovere and Branca Americano calculated the overall greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector, and how much gas release PROCEL avoided. PROCEL's contribution was significant. In the 1990s, the bulk of Brazil's energy consumption was supplied by hydropower, so the emissions from the sector were modest. In 1997, emissions from the Brazilian power sector were 17 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. In the same year, PROCEL activities avoided the emission of 1.2 million tonnes of greenhouse gases (in carbon dioxide equivalent).The PROINFA: Incentives for renewable energy sourcesIn April 2002, the Brazilian Congress approved a law aiming to establish a compulsory market for renewable energy. The law also provides the necessary legal support for creating a scheme to feed power from renewable sources into the national electricity grid. The programme, called Programa de Incentivos às Fontes Alternativas de Energia Elétrica (PROINFA) helps independent power producers using renewable sources of energy supply a higher share of electricity to the national grid.PROINFA has two phases. The first will install 3,300 megawatts of electricity-generating capacity based on biomass, small hydro power plants and wind power. This represents just under one per cent of the total electricity production in 2002. PROINFA's second phase was intended to increase the share of these sources to ten per cent. But new regulations in the power sector have necessitated a review of this target, and PROINFA's second phase is not yet defined.Stimulating large hydropower investmentsLula da Silva's national government administration changed the power sector regulations, to increase the attractiveness of, and opportunities for, private investments in hydropower generation. The new regulations mean that hydropower projects cannot be presented to public tender until after the governmental energy planning agency grants an environmental licence. The aim is to reduce environmental risks to investors, and to stimulate hydropower investments.Other energy programmesIn 2002, Brazil proposed the Brazilian Energy Initiative, which set targets to increase renewable energy use throughout Latin America. The chosen target was to have ten per cent of energy needs supplied from renewable sources by 2010. The initiative received strong support at a meeting of the ministers of environment from Latin American and Caribbean Countries held in May 2002, and influenced negotiations on renewable energies during the World Sustainable Development Summit. The summit's final documents call on countries to "work with urgency to substantially increase" the global share of renewable energy. The summit urged countries to switch government subsidies from nuclear and fossil fuels to cleaner energy sources, in order to encourage the growth of renewable energy sectors.Brazil is one of the few countries in the world that uses charcoal in the production of iron and steel. Because the charcoal comes from a renewed crop, this reduced emissions of carbon dioxide in the industrial sector by 50 millions tonnes between 1990 and 2000.Finally, Brazil has just launched a National Biodiesel Program, aiming to progressively increase the share of biodiesel content in diesel fuel used all over the country. The goal is to have at least three per cent of biodiesel added to fossil diesel by 2008, and five per cent by 2012. Currently, no biodiesel is used in Brazil. Biodiesel can be produced from several beans and palms that grow easily in Brazil, such as dendê, castor bean, soybean, sunflower, peanuts and others. It can also be made from animal fat, sewage and used vegetable oil. The National Biodiesel Program aims to promote biodiesel produced from castor beans and dendê palm produced by smallholder agriculture in poor areas, such as the country's north and northeast regions.The government's stance on future emission targetsBrazil is an important developing-country player in international climate change negotiations, and, with China and India, one of the three largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the developing world.Brazil maintains that yearly emissions should not be seen as a proxy for a country's responsibility for climate change. This responsibility, it argues, is more closely related to contribution to global temperature increase. Since carbon dioxide, the most important greenhouse gas, remains in the atmosphere for more than one century on average, past emissions need to be taken into account. As a result, in international negotiations, Brazil has refused to accept emission targets before the middle of the century. At that time, Brazil believes that the burden of responsibility for the total emissions present in the atmosphere would be the same for developing and developed countries.ConclusionBrazil's size in geographic, demographic and economic terms adds to the complexity of the climate change problem. Brazil leads many other countries in promoting renewable energy sources, which already occupy an important share of the energy mix and have great potential to grow further. Therefore, in terms of mitigating the energy sector's contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, Brazil has been doing very well. But the country still needs to study its vulnerability to climate change so it can prepare for the unavoidable effects of climate change. Unfortunately, in this field, Brazil is late in taking action.Brazil emission's profile is atypical: LULUCF emissions, notably from deforestation in the Amazon, are the main source of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. This is due to the scale of deforestation, but also because, unlike many countries, a large part of Brazil's power comes from renewable energy sources. Moreover, emissions from cattle contribute as much as energy sector emissions, in part because of the enormous number of cows—almost one per Brazilian citizen.Deforestation in the Amazon comes hand in hand with considerable biodiversity loss, and the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This is a crucial problem that must not be denied. Brazil claims a right not to be bound by the requirement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to reduce its emissions (even after the Kyoto Protocol has reached its term in 2012). The authors believe this should not be used as an excuse for failing to deal with the Amazon problem. On the other hand, he issue of the deforestation of the Amazon should be viewed independently of post-Kyoto negotiations. In either case, the authors welcome international and national pressure against deforestation in the Amazon.

To curb climate change, we need to protect waterAn international rescue plan for fresh waterIt is widely acknowledged that greenhouse gas emission-fueled climate change is having a profound and negative impact on fresh water systems around the world. Warmer weather causes more rapid evaporation of lakes and rivers, reduced snow and ice cover on open water systems, and melting glaciers.What is less understood is that our collective abuse and displacement of fresh water is also a serious cause of climate change and global warming. If we are to successfully address climate change, it is time to include an analysis of how our abuse of water is an additional factor in the creation of global warming as well as solutions that protect water and watersheds.There are two major factors. The first is the actual displacement of water from where it is sustaining a healthy ecosystem as well as healthy hydrologic cycles. Because humanity has polluted so much surface water on the planet, we are now mining the groundwater far faster than it can be replaced by nature. New Scientist reports of a "little-heralded crisis" all over Asia as a result of the exponential drilling of groundwater. Water is moved from where nature has put it in watershed and aquifers (where we can access it) to other place where it is used for flood irrigation and food production - where much of it lost to evaporation - or to supply the voracious thirst of mega cities, where it is usually dumped as waste into the ocean.Water is also lost to ecosystems through global trade - water used in the in the production of crops or manufactured goods that are then exported (known as virtual trade in water). Over 20% of daily water used for human purpose is exported out of watersheds in this way. Water is also piped across long distances for industry leaving behind parched landscapes.The second factor is the removal of the vegetation needed for a healthy hydrologic cycle. Urbanization, deforestation and wetland destruction greatly destroy water-retentive landscapes and lead to the loss of precipitation over the affected area.Slovakian scientist Michal Kravcik and his colleagues explain that the living world influences the climate mainly by regulating the water cycle and the huge energy flows linked to it. Transpiring plants, especially forests, work as a kind of biotic pump, causing humid air to be sucked out of the ocean and transferred to dry land. If the vegetation is removed from the land, this natural system of biosphere regulation is interrupted. Soil erodes, reducing the content of organic material in the ground, thus reducing its ability to hold water. Dry soil from lost vegetation traps solar heat, sharply increasing the local temperature and causing a reduction in precipitation over the affected area. This process also destroys the natural sequestration of carbon in the soil, leading to carbon loss.Of course, these two factors are deeply related. Just as removing vegetation from an ecosystem will dry up the soil, so too will removing water from an ecosystem mean reduced or non-existent vegetation.Taken together, these two factors are hastening the desertification of the planet, and intensifying global warming. Even if we successfully address and reverse greenhouse gas emissions and our dependence on fossil fuels, Kravcik says, we will not be able to stop climate change if we do not deal with the impact of our abuse of water on the planet.Unless we collectively address the crisis of fresh water and our cavalier treatment of the world's water systems, we will not restore the climate to health.Restoration of WatershedsThe solution to the water half of this crisis is the massive restoration of watersheds. Bring water back into parched landscapes. Return water that has disappeared by retaining as much rainwater as possible within the ecosystem so that water can permeate the soil, replenish groundwater systems, and return to the atmosphere to regulate temperatures and renew the hydrologic cycle. All human, industrial and agricultural activity must become part of this project, which could employ millions and alleviate poverty in the global South. Our cities must be ringed with green conservation zones and we must restore forests and wetlands - the lungs and kidneys of fresh water. For this to be successful, three basic laws of nature must be addressed.1. It is necessary to create the conditions that allow rainwater to remain in local watersheds. This means restoring the natural spaces where rainwater can fall and where water can flow. Water retention can be carried out at all levels: roof gardens in family homes and office buildings; urban planning that allows rain and storm water to be captured and returned to the earth; water harvesting in food production; capturing daily water discharge and returning it clean to the land, not to the rising oceans.2. We cannot continue to mine groundwater supplies at a rate greater than natural recharge. If we do, there will not be enough water for the next generation. Governments everywhere must undertake intensive research into their groundwater supplies and regulate groundwater takings before these underground reservoirs are gone. This may mean a shift in policy from export to domestic and local production.3. We must stop polluting our surface and groundwater sources - and we must back up this intention with strict legislation. Water abuse in oil and methane gas production and in mining must stop. We must wean ourselves of industrial and chemical-based agricultural practices and listen to the many voices sounding the alarm about the rush toward water-guzzling bio fuel farming. We need to promote "subsidiarity," whereby national policies and international trade rules support local food production in order to protect the environment and promote local sustainable agriculture. Such policies also discourage the virtual trade in water. Countries should also limit or ban the mass movement of water by pipeline. Government investment in water and wastewater infrastructure would save huge volumes of water lost every day. Local laws could enforce water-harvesting practices at every level.Toward a Water Secure WorldClearly, for this rescue plan to be successful, governments around the world must acknowledge the water crisis and the part the role water abuse plays in the warming (and drying) of the planet. This in turn means that a nation's water resources must be considered in every government policy at all levels. Nations must undertake intensive studies to ascertain the health of watersheds and groundwater reserves. All activities that will impact water must conform to a new ethic - backed by law - that protects water sources from pollution and over-pumping. This will likely mean a strong challenge to government policies that favour unlimited global economic growth.Nearly two billion people live in water-stressed regions of the earth. Until now, the UN has addressed this terrible reality with a program to give them access to groundwater sources. But current levels of groundwater takings are unsustainable. To truly realize the universal right to water, and to protect water for nature's own uses, means a revolution in the way we treat the world's finite water resources. There is no time to lose.

Reality check for 'miracle' biofuel cropThe hardy jatropha tree as a biofuel source may not be the panacea for smallholders that some have claimed, say Miyuki Iiyama and James Onchieku.It sounds too good to be true: a biofuel crop that grows on semi-arid lands and degraded soils, replaces fossil fuels in developing countries and brings huge injections of cash to poor smallholders.That is what some are claiming for Jatropha curcas, the 'miracle' biofuel crop. But studies on the ground suggest a lot more research and development (R&amp;D) is needed before farmers can come close to seeing any of the promised benefits.So what exactly is jatropha, and what has a 'reality check' on its potential revealed?About jatrophaJatropha is a small tree that grows to 3–5 metres in height and a member of the Euphorbiaceae family. It is native to Central America but is now grown in many parts of the tropics and subtropics. The seeds, which contain up to 35 per cent oil, can be processed into biodiesel for transport and biofuel for lighting and cooking.It is poisonous and cannot be used for food. In many places, it is also grown as a fence to exclude livestock, and is also used for traditional medicine. The seed cake, a by-product from biofuel production, can be used for fertiliser and animal feed, provided it is detoxified. The roots, which are able to reach water and nutrients deep in the soil, can cut soil erosion.A report by the UN Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) found that in 2008 jatropha was planted on about 900,000 hectares globally, the bulk -  760,000 hectares -  in Asia, along with 120,000 hectares in Africa and 20,000 in Latin America.But by 2015 jatropha planting will have risen more than ten times to 12.8 million hectares worldwide, the report estimatesThe hypeIt has only been in the past few years that interest in jatropha as a biofuel crop has mounted, particularly because of its purported ability to thrive on marginal land and in drought conditions.As for claims about the tree's fast-growing nature, early fruiting, pest and disease resistance due to its toxicity, and its potential to not only produce biodiesel, but also as fuel for light and heat for cooking.The media has chimed in too, with articles about the potential for jatropha to stop deforestation and provide greatly-increased incomes as international investments promise to convert wasteland into plantations that create thousands of jobs. Typical statements have been: 'Jatropha doesn't have to compete with food crops for arable land', and 'even in the worst of soils, it grows like weeds.'In an attempt to test the claims, Endelevu Energy, the World Agroforestry Centre and the Kenya Forestry Research Institute embarked on the Reality Check study supported by the German government, which we published last December.The realityThe main finding of the Reality Check is that jatropha is not economically viable when grown by smallholders in Kenya, either in a monoculture or intercrop plantation model. This is due to low yields and high production costs, and a lack of guidelines for applying agronomic and silvicultural best practices.Hundreds of farmers we interviewed for the study spoke of extremely low yields and uneconomical production costs. Many had paid as much as US$12–20 per kilogram for seeds, but received little or no advice on crop management, and were unable to access markets for the small number of seeds harvested. They chose to abandon the jatropha they had planted.The only case where we would recommend jatropha cultivation — and where it makes economic sense — is as a natural fence, as this needs few inputs. This is the way jatropha has been grown in East Africa since it was introduced centuries ago.As for the claim that jatropha can grow almost anywhere, our research found that while this may be the case, high yields are not guaranteed. Even in ideal conditions, the tree requires management to become productive, including pruning to increase the number of flowering branches, and adequate fertiliser and water.In addition, more than 75 per cent of farmers we spoke to reported at least one pest or disease in the course of a year, including golden beetle, leaf spotting, mildew and fungus.Meeting of mindsWhile we were analysing the situation in Kenya, the FAO and IFAD were conducting their review into the anti-poverty potential of jatropha at a global level.Our report shares many of their conclusions, in particular that yields are marginal, at best, and many of the investments and policy decisions on developing jatropha as an oil crop have been made without sufficient scientific evidence."Realising the true potential of jatropha requires separating facts from the claims and half truths," the FAO/IFAD report says.It does recognise that if well exploited, jatropha could provide opportunities for good returns and rural development, but "expecting jatropha to substitute significantly for oil imports in developing countries is unrealistic".Too soon for promisesSo, while it is possible that jatropha could eventually evolve into a higher yielding oil crop that is productive on marginal lands, and markets could be established for its oil and other useful by-products, it is far too soon to make such promises.The reality is that jatropha is still essentially a semi-wild plant and as such its seed yields, oil quality and oil content are all highly variable. Considerable research is needed into the agronomy of jatropha and crop improvement.The FAO/IFAD report recommends short-term research focused on producing superior clonal plants, with longer-term work on developing improved varieties with reliable trait expression and a seed production system that ensures farmer have access to productive and reliable planting materials.For now, the main potential of jatropha is as part of a strategy to reclaim degraded land, provide a source of locally processed and used oil, and as a hedgerow to control grazing. Until further R&amp;D is conducted — by establishing jatropha trials in various agro-ecological zones, with farmers informed of best practices — significant plantations remain risky and uneconomical. Only 'business as usual' should continue.

Charles BurneyCharles Burney (1726-1814), an English musical historian, was born at Shrewsbury on the 12th of April 1726. He received his earlier education at the free school of that city, and was afterwards sent to the public school at Chester. His first music master was Edmund Baker, organist of Chester cathedral, and a pupil of Dr John Blow. Returning to Shrewsbury when about fifteen years old, he continued his musical studies for three years under his half-brother, James Burney, organist of St Mary's church, and was then sent to London as a pupil of the celebrated Dr Arne, with whom he remained three years. Burney wrote some music for Thomson's Alfred, which was produced at Drury Lane theatre on the 30th of March 1745. In 1749 he was appointed organist of St Dionis-Backchurch, Fenchurch Street, with a salary of £30 a year; and he was also engaged to take the harpsichord in the "New Concerts" then recently established at the King's Arms, Cornhill. In that year he married Miss Esther Sleepe, who died in 1761; in 1769 he married Mrs Stephen Allen of Lynn. Being threatened with a pulmonary affection he went in 1751 to Lynn in Norfolk, where he was elected organist, with an annual salary of £loo, and there he resided for the next nine years. During that time he began to entertain the idea of writing a general history of music. His Ode for St Cecilia's Day was performed at Ranelagh Gardens in 1759; and in 1760 he returned to London in good health and with a young family; the eldest child, a girl of eight years of age, surprised the public by her attainments as a harpsichord player. The concertos for the harpsichord which Burney published soon after his return to London were regarded with much admiration. In 1766 he produced, at Drury Lane, a free English version and adaptation of J. J. Rousseau's operetta Le Devin du village, under the title of The Cunning Man. The university of Oxford conferred upon him, on the 23rd of June 1769, the degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Music, on which occasion he presided at the performance of his exercise for these degrees. This consisted of an anthem, with an overture, solos, recitatives and choruses, accompanied by instruments, besides a vocal anthem in eight parts, which was not performed. In 1769 he published An Essay towards a History of Comets. Amidst his various professional avocations, Burney never lost sight of his favourite object - his History of Music - and therefore resolved to travel abroad for the purpose of collecting materials that could not be found in Great Britain. Accordingly, he left London in June 1770, furnished with numerous letters of introduction, and proceeded to Paris, and thence to Geneva, Turin, Milan, Padua, Venice, Bologna, Florence, Rome and Naples. The results of his observations he published in The Present State of Music in France and Italy (1771). Dr Johnson thought so well of this work that, alluding to his own Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland, he said, "I had that clever dog Burney's Musical Tour in my eye." In July 1772 Burney again visited the continent, to collect further materials, and, after his return to London, published his tour under the title of The Present State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands and United Provinces (1773). In 1773 he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1776 appeared the first volume (in 4to) of his longprojected History of Music. In 1782 Burney published his second volume; and in 1789 the third and fourth. Though severely criticized by Forkel in Germany and by the Spanish ex-Jesuit, Requeno, who, in his Italian work Saggj sul Ristabilimento dell' Arte Armonica de' Greci e Romani Cantori (Parma, 1798), attacks Burney's account of the ancient Greek music, and calls him to scompigliato Burney, the History of Music was generally recognized as possessing great merit. The least satisfactory volume is the fourth, the treatment of Handel and Bach being quite inadequate. Burney's first tour was translated into German by Ebeling, and printed at Hamburg in 1772; and his second tour, translated into German by Bode, was published at Hamburg in 1773. A Dutch translation of his second tour, with notes by J. W. Lustig, organist at Groningen, was published there in 1786. The Dissertation on the Music of the Ancients, in the first volume of Burney's History, was translated into German by J. J. Eschenburg, and printed at Leipzig, 1781. Burney derived much aid from the first two volumes of Padre Martini's very learned Storia della Musica (Bologna, 1 757-177 0). One cannot but admire his persevering industry, and his sacrifices of time, money and personal comfort, in collecting and preparing materials for his History, and few will be disposed to condemn severely errors and oversights in a work of such extent and difficulty. In 1774 he had written A Plan for a Music School. In 1779 he wrote for the Royal Society an account of the infant Crotch, whose remarkable musical talent excited so much attention at that time. In 1784 he published, with an Italian title-page, the music annually performed in the pope's chapel at Rome during Passion Week. In 1785 he published, for the benefit of the Musical Fund, an account of the first commemoration of Handel in Westminster Abbey in the preceding year, with an excellent life of Handel. In 1796 he published Memoirs and Letters of Metastasio. Towards the close of his life Burney was paid 1000 for contributing to Rees's Cyclopaedia all the musical articles not belonging to the department of natural philosophy and mathematics. In 1783, through the treasury influence of his friend Edmund Burke, he was appointed organist to the chapel of Chelsea Hospital, and he moved his residence from St Martin's Street, Leicester Square, to live in the hospital for the remainder of his life. He was made a member of the Institute of France, and nominated a correspondent in the class of the fine arts, in the year 1810. From 1806 until his death he enjoyed a pension of X300 granted by Fox. He died at Chelsea College on the 12th of April 1814, and was interred in the burying-ground of the college. A tablet was erected to his memory in Westminster Abbey. Burney's portrait was painted by Reynolds, and his bust was cut by Nollekens in 1805. He had a wide circle of acquaintance among the distinguished artists and literary men of his day. At one time he thought of writing a life of his friend Dr Samuel Johnson, but he retired before the crowd of biographers who rushed into that field. His character in private as well as in public life appears to have been very amiable and exemplary. Dr Burney's eldest son, James, was a distinguished officer in the royal navy, who died a rear-admiral in 1821; his second son was the Rev. Charles Burney, D.D. (1757-1817), a well-known classical scholar, whose splendid collection of rare books and MSS was ultimately bought by the nation for the British Museum; and his second daughter was Frances (Madame D'Arblay). The Diary and Letters of Madame D'Arblay contain many minute and interesting particulars of her father's public and private life, and of his friends and contemporaries. A life of Burney by Madame D'Arblay appeared in 1832. Besides the operatic music above mentioned, Burney's known compositions consist of: - (i) Six Sonatas for the harpsichord; (2) Two Sonatas for the harp or piano, with accompaniments for violin and violoncello; (3) Sonatas for two violins and a bass: two sets; (4) Six Lessons for the harpsichord; (5) Six Duets for two German flutes; (6) Three Concertos for the harpsichord; (7) Six concert pieces with an introduction and fugue for the organ; (8) Six Concertos for the violin, etc., in eight parts; (9) Two Sonatas for pianoforte, violin and violoncello; (To) A Cantata, etc.; (ii) Anthems, etc.; (12) XII. Canzonetti a due voci in Canone, poesia dell' Abate Metastasio.

Requiem for Classical MusicA man stands surrounded by women. He is tall and handsome with long, flowing hair; the women are worshipful, kneeling at his feet. There is one particularly zealous admirer with large scissors, ready to cut a lock of his hair. If it werenít for the corsets and bustles, this could be a scene of a rock star being hounded by hysterical female fans. Yet, this is a caricature from 1876 depicting Franz Lizst and admirers after one of his concerts. A lot has changed since then. Today, such an enthusiastic reception is reserved for teen pop idols and movie stars. Even as overall sales of music grew steadily until the late 1990s, the sales of classical music CDs hovered at a scant 3 to 4 percent of the total. Record companies such as BMG Classics are slashing the number of new classical releases or, like CRI (a not-for-profit label which has recorded 42 Pulitzer Prize-winning composers), closing altogether. Classical music stations have disappeared in many cities; one-third of the nationís top 100 radio markets do not have a classical station. After 63 years, ChevronTexacoís radio broadcast from the Metropolitan Opera House will be off the air next year. Many symphony orchestras are cutting back programs and suffering financial difficulties. The Pittsburgh Symphony is selling its concert hall. A sign of the times: the "Death of Classical Music Archive" on ArtsJournal.com contains more than 50 recent articles on the topic.At the same time, it is easier than ever to buy any classical CD one might desire. A recent search on Amazon.com for Beethovenís Symphony No. 5 yielded a staggering 874 options, including 276 different recordings of a complete performance of all four movements. The choices included every imaginable compilation (from Beethoven: Greatest Hits to Beethoven: Super Hits) and every possible price point (from $2.98 for a performance by an unnamed orchestra to $101.98 for a boxed set with famed conductor Herbert von Karajan). Previously hard-to-find works are also more readily available. As a piano student 20 years ago, I had trouble locating Debussyís "Childrenís Corner" (a suite of miniatures for piano) performed by Walter Gieseking - but Amazon instantly offered up two choices.Moreover, attendance at classical concerts appears to be rising slightly. According to a 1997 survey commissioned by the National Endowment for the Arts, more than 15 percent of respondents attended a classical music event the previous year, a 3 percentage point increase from five years earlier. And while classicalís share of CDs is not large, it appears to have held steady over the past 20 years.So, is classical music dying? Or are the reports of its demise simply exaggerated?Everybody knows classical music when they hear it. Itís old. Itís serious. Itís stuffy. Yet, classical music is an imprecise term, generally referring to Western music from medieval times to the present day. Most of what is commonly called classical music is indeed old, dating back to the sixth century when church chants were first written down and codified. However, much new classical music is being written right now, and much more is still to be written. During the 2002-2003 season alone, 207 works were premiered worldwide.It is often assumed that all classical music is serious and is written with artistic merit as its purpose. But that is not the case. Classical music can be complex, deep, and intellectually meaty (like Beethoven or Brahms symphonies), but it also can be light, irreverent, and frivolous (like Strauss waltzes). And while knowledge and familiarity can enhance oneís enjoyment of classical music, they are not required, much in the way one neednít be an Elizabethan scholar to enjoy Shakespeare or a filmstudies major to enjoy movies. Many people enjoy classical music with little or no formal training.Whatever its pretensions, artistic or otherwise, until the 19th century the classical music business was relatively prosaic. The composer was a staff function within the machinery of social organizations like the royal court, which employed musicians to sing and play for worship in the cathedral and for entertainment at the palace. Many prominent composers, including Monteverdi, Haydn, and Mozart, held such positions. These hired composers/conductors/music directors generally worked at the whim of their employers, who were not always interested in music. Haydn is said to have composed the "Surprise" symphony to wake dozing patrons after a big meal and the "Farewell" symphony to send his employer a message that it was time to cut short a stay in the country because the musicians were homesick.Consequently, many famous works in classical music were composed because they were in the job description. For example, J.S. Bach (1685-1750) wrote his cycle of cantatas so that his choir would have a piece to perform each Sunday. And he dedicated the Brandenburg Concertos to a potential employer, as a job application of sorts. By all accounts, Bach was a methodical and industrious employee, "in the business of holding jobs." He did not set out to create masterpieces of artistic importance; those turned out to be fortunate by-products.The rise of the bourgeois class by the eighteenth century set the stage for change, including the appearance of freelance composers, star performers, and the modern market for music. As music moved out of the salons of aristocracy to the concert halls of the middle class, it became a public commercial activity in which the professional musicians performed for the paying audience. By the nineteenth century, many of the principles governing the classical music business today were already in place. The new system of an organized market for mass consumption of music required two key elements: star performers to attract an audience, and the supporting business apparatus to deliver the star and the music to the public efficiently. There were tickets to sell, seats to fill, and stars to manufacture and market.Which bring us back to Franz Lizst (1811-1886), a Hungarian- born composer-pianist and, along with NicolÅÚ Paganini, the first modern virtuoso and international superstar. First and foremost, there was his brilliant technique. In the words of Felix Mendelssohn, "Lizst has a certain suppleness and versatility in his fingers, as well as a thoroughly musical feeling, which may nowhere find its equal." But Lizst was also a showman. He heightened the effect of his technique by performing from memory (a requirement on todayís stage) and by refusing to share the stage with other musicians (before him, there were no solo recitals and no instrumentalist gave a concert without others). And not unlike todayís rock stars, his extra-musical activities and scandalous love affairs were integral to his mystique. Although critics and detractors considered him cheap and flashy, those very qualities made him a star. He gave his audience what they wanted.The twentieth century brought additional ways to consume music and new ways to promote star performers. Recordings, radio, television, and eventually the Internet further increased the potential audience for classical music. Tenor Enrico Caruso was the first recording star. His 1904 performance from the opera I Pagliacci became the first record to sell one million copies; and several other artists had top ten hits in the years between 1900 and 1920. Superstar conductors like Arturo Toscanini, Eugene Ormandy, and Leopold Stokowski were successful enough to become household names. Although accurate sales figures are hard to come by, Ormandy and Toscanini are reported to have sold more than 20 million records each over the course of their careers. And Stokowski shook hands with twentieth-century pop icon, Mickey Mouse, in Disneyís 1940 movie, Fantasia.In spite of the commercial success of its biggest stars, classical music recordings were not traditionally expected to make much of a profit, at least not a quick one. The typical recording sold at a relatively slow rate, two or three thousand on first release, but steadily over a longer period. Walter Legge, arguably the best-known record producer in the history of classical music, said that he wanted to make records that would sell for 20 or 30 years - and 40 years later, many still do. But this also meant that many recordings (especially those by large orchestras) wouldnít make a profit until they were reissued as part of a midprice or budget series. For the most part, record companies seemed content with the prestige and comparatively small profit margins of their classical recordings or were willing to subsidize them with profits from their pop divisions. They kept their focus on "documenting" star performances. "The major labels all operated on the principle that the best way to make money was to record prominent names in standard repertory. . . [and they] signed exclusive contracts with the biggest artists they could find," wrote music critic Terry Teachout in Commentary. Under this regime, Leonard Bernstein, Leontyne Price, Artur Rubinstein, and other big names continued to sell records into the 1960s and 1970s. Bernstein, in particular, brought classical music into millions of homes during the 1960s with his television series introducing classical music to young people.But cracks were appearing in the traditional business model. The market for classical music and its star performers began to shrink if not in absolute sales, at least relative to the alternatives: Elvis, the Beatles, and Michael Jackson. The explosion of other entertainment options such as television, movies, and later videogames only intensified the competition for the audienceís time and pocketbook.Moreover, this stars-and-standard-repertory approach also resulted in market saturation of the core product, the Bach-Beethoven-Brahms fare constituting the canon. Since a "new" product meant a recording of an old piece by a young performer or a second recording by a veteran, the number of recordings of a relatively small number of pieces eventually proliferated. The result was a catalog consisting of tens of thousands of titles - the majority concentrated in the standard repertory - which was expensive for labels and retailers to maintain and potentially confusing to fans.The industry also underwent several periods of consolidation including, a particularly intense round of mergers in the late 1980s and early 1990s. For example, Decca, a British label founded in 1929, merged with Polygram in 1980 (which itself was formed by a merger of Deutsche Grammophon and Philips in 1972) and then was incorporated into Universal Music after its purchase in 1998. Similarly, RCA (Toscaniniís label) is now part of Bertelsmann, a German conglomerate, and Columbia Records (Vladimir Horowitzís label) is part of Sony. As a division within a multinational conglomerate, these labels now competed directly with the more lucrative popular music divisions, and faced increasing pressure to maximize profits.It was under these circumstances, that classical music experienced its most unprecedented commercial triumph. The phenomenal success of the Three Tenors in the early 1990s changed expectations and set a new standard for the industry. "Gone were the days when it was acceptable for classical music sales to chug along at a few hundred per year. Now they were expected to perform like popular music divisions," observed Ian Lace in BBC Music Magazine.JosÅÈ Carreras, Placido Domingo, and Luciano Pavarotti, the three tenors of world renown, first sang together as a trio for the 1990 World Cup in Rome. What nobody could have imagined was the extraordinary success of this venture. About 800 million people worldwide saw the television broadcasts, and the recording, The Three Tenors in Concert, became by far the bestselling classical album of all time, with sales exceeding 10 million. The Three Tenors became both a franchise and a marketing concept. They went on to sing at subsequent World Cups (Los Angeles in 1994, Paris in 1998, and Yokohama in 2002), and spawned imitators like the Three Sopranos and even the Three Chinese Tenors.In addition to making the singers extremely rich, The Three Tenors in Concert had an enormous effect on the business. It demonstrated that a classical CD can sell in the millions. In the way that Star Wars changed the movie industry, The Three Tenors instigated the industryís relentless search for the next blockbuster that would immediately sell millions. Marketing became more expensive and sophisticated as companies worked to amplify small successes into hits. And some predicted this would help build a new, larger audience for classical music.Such efforts have been successful to a point, leading to a string of highly popular crossover albums that topped pop charts. A 1992 recording of Henryk GÅÛreckiís Third Symphony, a mournful work for soprano and orchestra by the contemporary Polish composer - previously more cult figure than superstar  - sold more than 1 million CDs. Even more successful was Chant, recorded by Benedictine monks in northern Spain. Originally promoted by EMI Spain as an antidote to stress, the company undertook a U.S. marketing campaign after sales began to rise that included reducing the two-CD recording to one disc, shortening the title from Las Mejores Obras del Canto Gregoriano (The Best of Gregorian Chants) to the snappier Chant, commissioning an eye-catching new cover, and even shooting a video clip to accompany "Alleluia, beatus vir qui suffert." Sales, in excess of 4 million, probably amount to more copies than all other Gregorian chant CDs combined.Yet, a business strategy based on crossover blockbusters has turned out to be unreliable. Just as nobody had imagined the extraordinary success of The Three Tenors, finding and marketing the next classical mega-hit has been difficult and unpredictable, with little guidance from the three very different hits mentioned above: The Three Tenors is a crowd-pleasing medley of songs including the greatest hits of the opera repertory sung by the reigning tenors of the day; Chant consists of simple, unaccompanied melodies from the very beginning of Western music; and GÅÛreckiís Third Symphony is a somber piece in the minimalist tradition by a modern composer. Notes then senior vice president at Decca (the record label responsible for The Three Tenors): "There are occasional miracles... but such blockbusters are rare... They have to be seen as special, almost freak occurrences."Moreover, if Amazonís "customers also bought" links are any indication, such one-time hits donít appear to have spilled over into increased sales in the standard repertoire. Customers who purchased The Three Tenors have also bought other crossover CDs, like Pavarottiís Greatest Hits or The #1 Opera Album, but donít appear to have ventured into traditional opera CDs, like Pavarottiís Turandot or La BohÅÈme.While the major recording companies pursued the seductive but elusive lure of mega-hits, a number of companies have been quite successful - commercially and artistically - by taking other approaches. The label Naxos, for example, records new versions of the standard repertory without star performers to keep costs reasonable; Hyperion and others specialize in recording and releasing less often heard, more adventurous works. The success of these firms suggests that classical music may still have some life in it yet.Classical music may never be the most popular music. And changes are afoot in the industry - and not only in classical music  - as the Internet and other technological advancements roil the landscape and challenge traditional ways of doing business. For example, the initial success of Appleís iTunes Music Store suggests there may be new and viable ways of buying recorded music over the Internet. These developments may change the ways in which we consume and experience classical music. But that does not necessarily signal its demise.However, both artists and business people need to think hard about who their future audience is going to be and how to make classical music exciting and relevant to that audience. Whether by delivering neglected repertory, or offering fresh interpretations of old favorites to a small but dedicated audience, or by shedding antiquated conventions and trying to expand into new territory, in the end, successful strategies will need to make people care about the music. These experiments may mean the death of the classical music business as we know it, but also may provide an opportunity for rebirth and renewal.

Pop musicPop music (a term that originally derives from an abbreviation of "popular") is a genre of popular music which originated in the 1950s, deriving from rock and roll. The terms popular music and pop music are often used interchangeably, even though the former is a description of any form of music which is popular (and can include any genre), whilst the latter is a specific genre of music which has qualities which would make it appealing to a large audience.Pop music, as a genre, is very eclectic, often borrowing elements from other styles throughout its course such as urban, dance, rock, Latin and country, yet there are core elements which define it. Such include generally short-to-medium length songs, written in a basic format which is often the verse-chorus structure, which generally make usage of repeated choruses, have a melodic sound, and have catchy hooks.So-called "pure pop" music, such as power pop, features all these elements, and for instrumentation uses electric guitars, drums and a bass; in the case of such music, the main goal is usually that of being pleasurable to listen to, rather than having much artistic depth. Pop music is generally thought of as a genre which is commercially recorded and desires to appeal to a mass audience.David Hatch and Stephen Millward define pop music as "a body of music which is distinguishable from popular, jazz and folk musics". Although pop music is often seen as oriented towards the singles charts it is not the sum of all chart music, which has always contained songs from a variety of sources, including classical, jazz, rock, and novelty songs, while pop music as a genre is usually seen as existing and developing separately. Thus "pop music" may be used to describe a distinct genre, aimed at a youth market, often characterized as a softer alternative to rock and roll.The term "pop song" is first recorded as being used in 1926, in the sense of a piece of music "having popular appeal". Hatch and Millward indicate that many events in the history of recording in the 1920s can be seen as the birth of the modern pop music industry, including in country, blues and hillbilly music.According to Grove Music Online, the term "pop music" "originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for Rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced ...". The Oxford Dictionary of Music states that while pop's "earlier meaning meant concerts appealing to a wide audience ... since the late 1950s, however, pop has had the special meaning of non-classical mus[ic], usually in the form of songs, performed by such artists as the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, ABBA, etc." Grove Music Online also states that "... in the early 1960s [the term] 'pop musicí competed terminologically with Beat music [in England], while in the USA its coverage overlapped (as it still does) with that of 'rock and rollí." Chambers' Dictionary mentions the contemporary usage of the term "pop art"; Grove Music Online states that the "term pop music ... seems to have been a spin-off from the terms pop art and pop culture, coined slightly earlier, and referring to a whole range of new, often American, media-culture products".From about 1967 the term was increasingly used in opposition to the term rock music, a division that gave generic significance to both terms. Whereas rock aspired to authenticity and an expansion of the possibilities of popular music, pop was more commercial, ephemeral and accessible. According to Simon Frith pop music is produced "as a matter of enterprise not art", is "designed to appeal to everyone" and "doesn't come from any particular place or mark off any particular taste". It is "not driven by any significant ambition except profit and commercial reward ... and, in musical terms, it is essentially conservative". It is, "provided from on high (by record companies, radio programmers and concert promoters) rather than being made from below ... Pop is not a do-it-yourself music but is professionally produced and packaged".Throughout its development, pop music has absorbed influences from most other genres of popular music. Early pop music drew on the sentimental ballad for its form, gained its use of vocal harmonies from gospel and soul music, instrumentation from jazz, country, and rock music, orchestration from classical music, tempo from dance music, backing from electronic music, rhythmic elements from hip-hop music, and has recently appropriated spoken passages from rap.It has also made use of technological innovation. In the 1940s improved microphone design allowed a more intimate singing style and ten or twenty years later inexpensive and more durable 45 r.p.m. records for singles "revolutionized the manner in which pop has been disseminated" and helped to move pop music to 'a record/radio/film star systemí. Another technological change was the widespread availability of television in the 1950s; with televised performances, "pop stars had to have a visual presence". In the 1960s, the introduction of inexpensive, portable transistor radios meant that teenagers could listen to music outside of the home. Multi-track recording (from the 1960s); and digital sampling (from the 1980s) have also been utilized as methods for the creation and elaboration of pop music. By the early 1980s, the promotion of pop music had been greatly affected by the rise of Music Television channels like MTV, which "favoured those artists such as Michael Jackson and Madonna who had a strong visual appeal".Pop music has been dominated by the American and (from the mid-1960s) British music industries, whose influence has made pop music something of an international monoculture, but most regions and countries have their own form of pop music, sometimes producing local versions of wider trends, and lending them local characteristics. Some of these trends (for example Europop) have had a significant impact of the development of the genre.According to Grove Music Online, "Western-derived pop styles, whether coexisting with or marginalizing distinctively local genres, have spread throughout the world and have come to constitute stylistic common denominators in global commercial music cultures". Some non-Western countries, such as Japan, have developed a thriving pop music industry, most of which is devoted to Western-style pop, has for several years has produced a greater quantity of music of everywhere except the USA. The spread of Western-style pop music has been interpreted variously as representing processes of Americanization, homogenization, modernization, creative appropriation, cultural imperialism, and/or a more general process of globalization.Musicologists often identify the following characteristics as typical of the pop music genre:* an aim of appealing to a general audience, rather than to a particular sub-culture or ideology* an emphasis on craftsmanship rather than formal "artistic" qualities* an emphasis on recording, production, and technology, over live performance* a tendency to reflect existing trends rather than progressive developments* much pop music is intended to encourage dancing, or it uses dance-oriented beats or rhythmsThe main medium of pop music is the song, often between two and a half and three and a half minutes in length, generally marked by a consistent and noticeable rhythmic element, a mainstream style and a simple traditional structure. Common variants include the verse-chorus form and the thirty-two-bar form, with a focus on melodies and catchy hooks, and a chorus that contrasts melodically, rhythmically and harmonically with the verse. The beat and the melodies tend to be simple, with limited harmonic accompaniment. The lyrics of modern pop songs typically focus on simple themes - often love and romantic relationships - although there are notable exceptions.Harmony in pop music is often "that of classical European tonality, only more simple-minded." ClichÅÈs include the barbershop harmony (i.e. moving from a secondary dominant harmony to a dominant harmony, and then to the tonic) and blues scale-influenced harmony. "The influence of the circle-of-fifths paradigm has declined since the mid-1950s. The harmonic languages of rock and soul have moved away from the all-encompassing influence of the dominant function. ...There are other tendencies (perhaps also traceable to the use of a guitar as a composing instrument) - pedal-point harmonies, root motion by diatonic step, modal harmonic and melodic organization - that point away from functional tonality and toward a tonal sense that is less directional, more free-floating."

Famous Violinist of Today and YesterdayArcangelo Corelli, whose name is recognised as one of the greatest in the history of violin playing and composition, and who laid the foundation for all future development of technique, was born in 1653, at Fusignano, near Imola, in the territory of Bologna. He showed an early propensity for the violin, and studied under Bassani, a man of extensive knowledge and capabilities, while Mattei Simonelli was his instructor in counterpoint. Corelli at one time sought fame away from home, and he is said to have visited Paris, where Lulli, the chief violinist of  that city, exhibited such jealousy and violence that the mild-tempered Corelli withdrew. In 1680 he went to Germany, where he was well received, and entered the service of the Elector of Bavaria, but he soon returned to Rome. His proficiency had now become so great that his fame extended throughout Europe, and pupils flocked to him. His playing was characterised by refined taste and elegance, and by a firm and even tone.  When the opera was well established in Rome, about 1690, Corelli led the band. His chief patron in Rome was Cardinal Ottoboni, and it was at his house that an incident occurred which places Corelli at the head of those musicians who have from time to time boldly maintained the rights of music against conversation. He was playing a solo when he noticed the cardinal engaged in conversation with another person. He immediately laid down his violin, and, on being asked the reason, answered that "he feared the music might interrupt the conversation." Corelli was a man of gentle disposition and simple habits. His plainness of dress and freedom from ostentation gave the impression that he was parsimonious, and Handel says of him that "he liked nothing better than seeing pictures without paying for it, and saving money," He was also noted for his objection to riding in carriages. He lived on terms of intimacy with the leading artists of his time, and had a great fondness for pictures, of which he had a valuable collection. These he left at his death to Cardinal Ottoboni. It was at Cardinal Ottoboni's that Corelli became acquainted with Handel, and at one of the musical evenings there a "Serenata," written by the latter, was performed. Corelli does not seem to have played it according to the ideas of the composer, for Handel, giving way to his impetuous temper, snatched the fiddle out of Correlli's hand. Corelli mildly remarked, "My dear Saxon, this music is in the French style, with which I am not acquainted." For many years Corelli remained at Rome, but at last he yielded to temptation and went to Naples, where Scarlatti induced him to play some of his concertos before the king. This he did in great fear, for he had not his own orchestra with him. He found Scarlatti's musicians able to play at first sight as well as his own did after rehearsals, and, the performance going off well, he was again admitted to play, this time one of his sonatas, in the royal presence. The king found the adagio so long and dry that he quitted the room, much to Corelli's mortification. But greater trouble was in store for the virtuoso. Scarlatti had written a masque, which was to be played before the king, but owing to the composer's limited knowledge of the violin, Corelli's part was very awkward and difficult, and he failed to execute it, while the Neapolitan violinists played it with ease. To make matters worse, Corelli made an unfortunate mistake in the next piece, which was written in the key of C minor, and led off in C major. The mistake was repeated, and Scarlatti had to call out to him to set him right. His mortification was so great that he quietly left Naples and returned to Rome. He found here a new violinist, Valentini, who had won the admiration of the people, and he took it so much to heart that his health failed, and he died in January, 1713. Corelli was buried in princely style in the Pantheon, not far from Raphael's tomb, and Cardinal Ottoboni erected a monument over his grave. During many years after his death a solemn service, consisting of selections from his own works, was performed in the Pantheon on the anniversary of his funeral. On this occasion, the works were performed in a slow, firm, and distinct manner, just as they were written, without changing the passages in the way of embellishment, and this is probably the way in which he himself played them. Corelli's compositions are remarkable for delicate taste and pleasing melodies and harmonies. He must be considered as the author of the greatest improvement which violin music underwent at the beginning of the eighteenth century. These compositions are regarded as invaluable for the instruction of young players, and some of them may be frequently heard in the concert-room at the present day, two hundred years since they were written. Corelli's most celebrated pupils, Somis, Locatelli, Geminiani, and AnÅÍt, settled respectively in Italy, Holland, England, and Poland. Giovanni Battista Somis was born in Piedmont, and, after studying under Corelli, he went to Venice and studied under Vivaldi. He was appointed solo violinist to the king at Turin and leader of the royal band, and seems scarcely ever to have left Turin after these appointments. Little is known of his playing or his compositions, but, by the work of his pupils, it is evident that he possessed originality. He formed a style more brilliant and more emotional, and caused a decided step forward in the art of violin playing. He was the teacher of Leclair, Giardini, and Chiabran, as well as Pugnani, and he forms a connecting link between the classical schools of Italy and France. Pietro Locatelli was born at Bergamo, and became a pupil of Corelli at a very early age. He travelled considerably, and was undoubtedly a great and original virtuoso. He has been accused of charlatanism, inasmuch as he overstepped all reasonable limits in his endeavours to enlarge the powers of execution of the violin, and has, on that account, been called the grandfather of our modern "finger-heroes." Locatelli settled in Amsterdam, where he died in 1764. There he established regular public concerts, and he left a number of compositions, some of which are used at the present day. Jean Baptiste Lulli, one of the earliest violinists in France, is perhaps associated with the violin in a manner disproportionate to the part he actually played in its progress. He was a musician of great ability, and his compositions are occasionally heard even to this day. Lulli was born near Florence about 1633. When quite young he was taken to France by the Chevalier de Guise, and entered the service of Mlle. de Montpensier. He was employed in the kitchen, where he seems to have lightened his burdens by playing tricks on the cook and tunes on the stewpans. He also beguiled his leisure hours by playing the violin, in which art he made such progress that the princess engaged a regular instructor for him. Fortunately, as it turned out, his wit led him into composing a satirical song on his employer, and he was sent off, but shortly afterwards secured a post as one of the king's violinists in the celebrated band of the twenty-four violins. Soon after this a special band called Les Petits Violons was formed with Lulli at their head, and under his direction it surpassed the band of twenty-four. Lulli found great favour at court, and, indeed, astonished the world with his exquisite taste and skill. That he was firmly established in the favour of the king is shown by the story that, when Corelli came to France and played one of his sonatas, King Louis listened without showing any sign of pleasure, and, sending for one of his own violinists, requested him to play an aria from Lulli's opera of "Cadmus et Hermione," which, he declared, suited his taste. There is little doubt that the principles of the great Italian school of violin playing were, some years later, brought into France by AnÅÍt, who was born in 1680, and returned from Italy about 1700, but owing to the jealousies of his colleagues, he found it advisable to leave France in a short time, and he is said to have spent the rest of his life as conductor of the private band of a nobleman in Poland. Lulli is said to have been very avaricious, and his wealth included four houses, all in the best quarters of Paris, together with securities and appointments worth about $70,000. His death, in 1687, was caused by a peculiar accident. While conducting a performance of his orchestra he struck his foot with the cane which he used for marking the time. The bruise gradually assumed such a serious condition that it ended his life. Jean Baptiste SenaillÅÈ, who was a pupil of AnÅÍt, was born in 1687, and turned to the Italian school. In 1719 he entered the service of the Duke of Orleans. Francesco Geminiani was considered the ablest of the pupils of Corelli, and was born about 1680. When about twenty-four years of age he went to England, where his talent secured a great reputation for him, some people even declaring him to be superior, as a player, to Corelli. He lived to an advanced age, and was in Dublin visiting his pupil Dubourg at the time of his death. He was a man of unsettled habits, and was frequently in dire necessity, caused chiefly by his love of pictures, which led him into unwise purchases, and thus frequently into debt. About the year 1650 three violinists were born in Italy, who all left their mark upon the history of violin playing. Tommaso Vitali was born at Bologna, and was leader of the orchestra in that city, and later in Modena.  Giuseppe Torelli was leader of a church orchestra in Bologna, and afterwards accepted the post of leader of the band of the Markgraf of Brandenburg-Anspach, at Anspach, in Germany. To him is generally ascribed the invention of the "Concerto." Antonio Vivaldi was the son of a violinist, and sought his fortune in Germany, but returned to his native city in 1713. He wrote extensively for the violin, and is said to have added something to the development of its technique. An anecdote is told of him to the effect that one day during mass a theme for a fugue struck him. He immediately quitted the altar at which he was officiating, for he united clerical with musical duties, and, hastening to the sacristy to write down the theme, afterwards returned and finished the mass. For this he was brought before the Inquisition, but being considered only as a "musician," a term synonymous with "madman," the sentence was mild - he was forbidden to say mass in the future.

Alzheimer's DiseaseIntroductionAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease or a disease that causes progressive damage to brain cells leading to slow but relentless mental decline.  The most common early symptoms with AD are difficulty learning and remembering new information, problems navigating familiar routes, difficulty with finding words, and deficits in multi-tasking (doing several things at once). As AD progresses, memory and spatial problems worsen and new cognitive problems arise, including deficits in understanding and expressing ideas, loss of the ability to calculate, read and write, and severe difficulties with problem-solving. Usually patients maintain their social graces but as the illness progresses behavioral symptoms including apathy, agitation, anxiety, and delusions (false beliefs) emerge. Eventually, the cognitive and behavioral problems associated with AD cause "dementia," defined as cognitive impairment severe enough to interfere with daily life activities such as work, social interactions, hobbies, or self-care. There are many diseases that cause dementia, although AD is the most common cause of dementia in older adults.                    Causes/Risk FactorsWhat are the factors that cause people to develop those neurobiological changes? Without a doubt, the most important risk is aging.  Incidence, or new cases of AD, approximately double every five years after the age of 65 years.  In the very old, (above 90), the number of people who manifest AD-like changes is extremely high, leading some to believe that if we all lived long enough we would all get AD.  How aging leads to these changes remains unknown. For some, genetic factors contribute to, or even cause development of the disease. This risk is greatest for those with a strong family history of AD, and for individuals whose family members were diagnosed with AD before age 65. Familial AD, which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, is caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21, the presenilin 1 gene on chromosome 14, or the presenilin 2 gene on chromosome 1. These mutations all lead to excessive production of a protein called beta amyloid (Aβ). With this genetic form of AD, if the gene is carried there is near 100% likelihood that the person will develop AD if they live beyond 60 years.  Less than 5% of AD cases are transmitted in this fashion.  A more common genetic risk is associated with the apolipoprotein gene on chromosome 19. This gene has three common variants or alleles, called APOE-e2, APOE-e3, and APOE-e4. Individuals with 1 or 2 copies of the APOE-e4 allele have a substantially increased risk for AD, whereas individuals with 1 or 2 copies of the APOE-e2 allele have decreased risk. Unlike the familial genes that cause AD, having APOE-e4 does not guarantee that you will get AD, but increases your risk substantially. In addition, having Down's syndrome, or a family history of other dementias or Parkinson's disease, also appears to increase risk.The remaining risks for developing AD appears to come from environmental factors, although the precise mechanisms by which these risk factors contribute to AD is not entirely known. Head injury is one of the most preventable environmental risk factors. Typically, head injuries are only considered risks when there is a loss of consciousness, which indicates brain trauma. Other potentially modifiable environmental risk factors include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes, which can be reduced through diet and exercise. Diets rich in antioxidants, Vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids may reduce risk for AD, while diets high in fat and calories increase risk. In addition, exercise may reduce risk for AD by improving cerebrovascular health and promoting the growth of new neurons in brain regions responsible for memory.  Education is commonly considered to be a preventive factor, but the relationship between education level and AD is complex. Individuals with very high levels of education are typically diagnosed with AD less frequently and at older ages than similar individuals with less education. However, autopsy examinations show greater brain shrinkage in individuals with high education levels, which is an indication of greater progression of AD. Many researchers now believe that education and the associated intellectual strengths that come with it cannot prevent AD, but delay the diagnosis through what is referred to as "cognitive reserve," or a cognitive cushion that buffers one against showing symptoms of AD.Depression, and particularly depression that occurs first in older adulthood, has been suggested to be a risk factor. Whether or not late-life depression is a risk, or rather just an an early sign of AD is still unknown. Having depression at younger ages does not appear to be a risk factor for AD.Female gender is associated with a slightly increased risk of developing AD. It is unclear, however, whether that risk stems primarily from the tendency of women to live longer than men, which puts them at increased risk simply by virtue of their older age.ProgressionAlzheimer's disease is known for its insidious onset and slow progression. It is preceded by a stage where cognitive functioning is diminished relative to peers of a similar age and education level, but which is not sufficiently severe to merit a diagnosis of AD. This stage is sometimes called mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild AD; however, not everyone diagnosed with MCI will go on to develop AD. Although there are no true distinctions between different stages of the disease, these stages may be helpful in describing the disease progression. It typically takes years for a person with AD to progress from 1 stage to another, and because there are no clear demarcations between stages, there is often overlap.The medial temporal and parietal areas of the brain are typically the first areas to appear shrunken as neurons die. Shrinkage is particularly early and prominent in the hippocampi, structures that are needed for making new memories, and in the posterior parietal lobes, which are involved in spatial skills, navigation, and calculation. Later, nearly the entire brain appears shrunken, and the spaces within the brain, called ventricles, grow larger.                      Memory and spatial problems are usually the first symptoms seen and are disproportionate to problems with attention, organizing, and multi-tasking. About half of people with AD have one or more psychiatric symptoms such as depression, apathy, or insomnia in the early to moderate stages. Agitation and insomnia become more common in the moderate stages of the disease, while behavioral disturbances are most likely to emerge in the moderate to severe stages. Of note, although people with AD have pronounced cognitive problems, they typically retain social skills until they are in the moderate to severe stages. These characteristics can help differentiate between AD and other types of dementia.Impairments in activities of daily living, or basic living skills such as bathing and dressing one's self, frequently do not occur until the moderate to severe stages of the disease. Difficulties with bathing and dressing may be the first observed difficulties that occur in the moderate stage, while difficulties eating and toileting occurring more frequently in the severe stage. In addition, memory and judgment problems can impair safe self-care in the moderate to severe stages of the disease. Because AD tends to spare the motor systems until the latest stages of the disease, people with AD typically do not need wheelchairs or other movement aids as a result of the disease, although, of course, other medical problems common to aging may necessitate such devices.In the last stage of the disease, which is sometimes called the terminal stage, people are frequently cared for in institutions due to increased care demands. At this stage, people may have difficulty swallowing whole foods and thin liquids, and consequently may need to drink thickened liquids for nutrition. Tube feeding is sometimes implemented in institutions if a patient has difficulty swallowing even thickened liquids or refuses nutrition. However, tube feeding tends to be very uncomfortable and may not improve survival or reduce the risk of aspiration pneumonia 11, and so its use should be carefully considered. Reduced mobility, often leading patients to be bed-bound, increases risk for infections and bedsores. Because people with terminal stage AD have very reduced ability to make decisions and communicate, family members should be actively involved in making treatment decisions and ensuring care that is consistent with the patient's desires and values.DiagnosisA thorough evaluation, which is the best way to distinguish between AD and other neurodegenerative disorders or normal aging, can be complex and ideally requires a multi-disciplinary team of physicians, nurses, neuropsychologists, and social workers. Such an evaluation often includes:   1. a careful history, including:         1. family history of neurological disease         2. current symptoms         3. the onset and course of symptoms         4. risk factors for AD and other neurological disorders         5. medical history         6. current medications         7. drug and alcohol use         8. sleep habits         9. education level and work history   2. a neurological exam, which examines:         1. cranial nerves         2. gait         3. balance and stability         4. motor function and motor sequences         5. sensory perception and discrimination         6. reflexes   3. cognitive or neuropsychological exam, which tests:         1. verbal and nonverbal learning and memory         2. visuospatial perception and copying/drawing ability         3. speech and language skills         4. attention         5. processing speed         6. executive functioning (higher-order cognitive tasks such as mentally manipulating information, mental flexibility, response inhibition, planning, problem solving, abstraction, and judgment)         7. motor speed         8. mood   4. blood work, which looks for signs of:         1. infection         2. kidney dysfunction         3. liver dysfunction         4. B12 or folic acid deficiency         5. thyroid dysfunction         6. autoimmune disorders   5. neuroimaging, using 1 or more of the following techniques:         1. CT or MRI --- examines brain structure for places of atrophy characteristic of AD         2. PET or SPECT --- examine brain function for places of hypometabolism or hypoperfusion characteristic of AD.  This test is only recommended for patients in whom diagnosis is difficult.  After an evaluation, a person who is thought to have AD may be given a diagnosis of "probable AD," "possible AD," or "amnestic MCI."  MCI is an early stage where cognitive dysfunction is documented, but is not sufficiently severe to interfere with daily life. People with amnestic MCI show deficits primarily ---or only--- in the area of memory, and are at high risk of progressing to AD.  Probable AD is diagnosed when a person has been established to have dementia by a clinical examination and neuropsychological testing, the dementia onset was between ages 40 and 90, the person shows deficits in 2 or more cognitive domains, has progressive memory loss and other cognitive deterioration, is not delirious, and does not have other disorders that could be responsible for causing the symptoms. Possible AD is diagnosed when a person shows a slow progressive deterioration in only one cognitive area or has been diagnosed with another disorder that could produce dementia. A definitive diagnosis of AD cannot be made until the brain has been directly examined for the characteristic pathological signs of AD, which typically occurs only at autopsy. However, due to the amount of research that has been conducted on AD, when pre-autopsy diagnoses are made after a thorough evaluation, diagnoses have a high degree of accuracy.There are many causes for dementia that are not due to AD, including other degenerative conditions such as frontotemporal dementia, vascular dementia, Parkinsonian-dementia and medical conditions such as B12 deficiency. Accurate diagnosis is the key to effective therapy.  TreatmentOnce a diagnosis of AD has been made, treatment of the disease should be considered.  Treatment has many components and should focus around the following:o       Symptomatic therapy with medicationso       Treatment of difficult behaviors with medicationso       Treatment of difficult behaviors with changes in the environmento       Organizing finances, legal issues, advanced directiveso       Making sure that the caregiver maintains his or her health Symptomatic therapy with medications: Currently there are two types of medications approved for the treatment of AD, cholinesterase inhibitors and NMDA antagonists.  Cholinesterase inhibitors work by increasing the brain's level of acetylcholine, and they are the mainstay of AD treatment.  The three cholinesterase inhibitors used in medical practice are Donepezil (Aricept), Rivastigmine (Exelon), and Galantamine (Razadyne).  When these medications work they typically lead to mild improvements in attention, thinking, and memory.  Generally, patients on these medications do better than patients not taking them.  Donepezil, Rivastigmine and Galantamine are all approved for treatment of mild to moderate AD, while Donepezil is also approved for treatment of severe disease.  The side effects of these medications are low, with gastrointestinal upset and sleep disturbance the major concerns.  When AD is diagnosed the patient should be started on one of the cholinesterase inhibitors.  Memantine (Namenda) is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe AD and it works by blocking areas in the brain that are overexcited by a neurotransmitter called glutamate.  Memantine can be added to a cholinesterase inhibitor, or used alone, and has few side effects. None of these medications leads to miraculous improvements, but even subtle changes in patients can be a big positive for caregivers.  New medications designed to slow the aggregation of Aβ are under active study and may have more impressive effects than the current generation of compounds.  Treatment of Difficult Behaviors with Medications or Environmental Changes: Treating agitated or unwanted behaviors is extremely difficult and should always begin by thinking about why the behavior has emerged.  AD patients may not be able to explain how they feel.  Pain associated with a urinary infection, tooth decay, or back problems can manifest as agitation or confusion.  Similarly, depressed mood can trigger difficult behaviors.  Therefore, a careful medical evaluation is important if behavior has changed.  Additionally, review of possible environment triggers is needed.  Sleep in the daytime will often mean that the patient stays awake at night.  Lack of exercise will increase the likelihood that the patient will become irritable or agitated.  Overstimulation and big changes in the environment often precipitate difficult behaviors. Medications for these behaviors have limited value and often make things worse rather than better.  Sometimes antidepressant compounds will smooth out difficult periods.  Antipsychotic and anxiolytic medications have significant toxicities and are typically most effective when they are used in low doses for limited periods of time. Organizing finances, legal issues, advanced directives: Thinking ahead is a key to effective caregiving.  AD is a continually changing illness and what works at one stage may not work later on.  Eventually patients lose their ability to make good decisions and the family will need to consider wills, financial decision-making, and advanced directives for health care at the earliest possible stage. Included in this planning is the designation of a health care proxy --- a person who is chosen to make medical decisions once the patient is unable to participate in these him or herself.Making sure that the caregiver maintains his or her health:  Caregiving is one of the most difficult tasks that we will ever face.  Maintaining good health and good spirits is essential.  Exercise programs, time alone, daycare, sitters, respite programs, and support groups can make caregiving less difficult and should be considered at all stages of the illness.  The Alzheimer's Association can aid families in accessing health support.  Practical tips for living with ADPeople may feel overwhelmed after being diagnosed with AD. Some find it helpful to read about the disease, so that they understand their diagnosis and know better what to expect as the disease progresses. Understanding the disease and prognosis can help you plan for your future and make important decisions, such as creating an advance health care directive, and making decisions about how and where you want to live. It is also helpful to have a trusted friend or family member with you at your medical appointments. This person can help you in a number of ways. He or she can ask your doctor important questions, help you remember the information your doctor provides you, help plan future appointments or make other relevant plans, provide emotional support, and help you get to and from your appointments.In addition, AD affects more people than those diagnosed with it --- it affects family members and other loved ones. Behavioral problems are typically more difficult for caregivers and other loved ones than are memory problems. Here are several behavioral issues that frequently arise with AD, and ways that may help deal with them.    * Suspicion or paranoia: People with AD sometimes become suspicious of others. If you are the subject of that suspicion, it can be hurtful and confusing. It is helpful to understand that people with AD frequently become suspicious because they cannot keep track of things as well as they used to; when they move something, they often cannot remember that they have done so. It therefore seems to them that their environment, and the valuable things in it, changes inexplicably, and so they make sense of these changes by thinking that other people must be stealing from them. This thought typically has nothing to do with how trustworthy a loved one has been, and it is usually the person or people closest to the AD patient who is blamed. Rather than defending yourself, or getting emotional if this happens, you can help the person look for whatever has been misplaced. Or, if possible, you can replace it.    * Forgotten bills: People with AD can have a difficult time paying bills, keeping track of their finances, and otherwise managing their money. They can also be at risk for elder financial abuse. Caregivers often find their lives improve dramatically when they take over handling the finances, and no longer have to worry about whether or not the bills are being paid. Being involved with finances also can help prevent elder financial abuse, or enable any scams or fraud to be quickly recognized and remedied.    * Personality changes: Although personality change is typically not as striking in AD as it is in some other types of dementias, it is not uncommon. People with AD can become agitated, confused, depressed, anxious, stubborn, or needy. Some personality or emotional changes, such as depression, can be treated pharmacologically. Sometimes, it is helpful to recognize that personality changes can be the result of poorer cognitive skills --- that when people cannot communicate their thoughts and feelings well verbally, they communicate through actions. Identifying "triggers," or the preceding events or circumstances, of unwanted behavior can help you understand what may be distressing to the person. Once you understand this, you can modify the environment appropriately. In addition, blame the disease for the distressing behavior or personality changes, rather than blaming the person.    * Fluctuating symptoms: One of the most confusing things to many caregivers is that a loved one with AD can sometimes seem to remember things, or be able to perform certain tasks, and other times cannot. This is normal, and it is part of the disease process. Although it may seem that a person is "faking" when their symptoms are worse, or that they should be able to do something all the time if they can do it some of the time, neither of these ideas are true. People with AD truly do have fluctuating abilities. Blaming the disease for these frustrating and confusing moments, rather than blaming the person with AD for not always being able to do things, is very helpful. It is also helpful to simply recognize that symptoms, including cognitive abilities, fluctuate over the course of the day and change over time.    * Wandering: Individuals with AD often leave their home to take a walk or with the intention of going somewhere, but become disoriented or lost. It's not unusual for caregivers to become panicked when they realize that the person with AD is gone. To prevent wandering, you can affix a bell to the door, so that you are alerted when the person with AD is trying to leave, or post a sign on the door that says, "Do not open". There are also steps you can take to help find the person who has wandered. First, you can have the person wear an ID bracelet with the person's name and your phone number. Second, you can enroll the person in the Alzheimer's Association's Safe Return program, which provides an ID bracelet or pendant, a "community support network to help reunite the lost person with his or her caregiver," and 24-hour wandering or medical emergency response services. Third, you can call the police. Try not to be angry or overly emotional when you find your loved one after he or she has wandered --- this will only be upsetting, and not helpful. In addition to these steps, it may be helpful to take walks with the person during the daytime, to enable him or her to get exercise while giving yourself the security of knowing where he or she is.In addition to these suggestions, there are a number of organizations that can provide help. These organizations can provide answers to your questions, support groups to help cope with emotional distress and practical difficulties, and resources to help you learn more about AD and cope with the diagnosis.

Caring for Aging Parents &amp; Elder Rage: Know The Warning Signs of Alzheimer's!For eleven years I pleaded with my obstinate elderly father to allow acaregiver to help him with my ailing mother, but after 55 years of lovingeach other he adamantly insisted on taking care of her himself. Everycaregiver I hired to help him soon called in exasperation, "Jacqueline, Ijust can't work with your father-his temper is impossible to handle. I don'tthink he'll accept help until he's on his knees himself."My father had always been 90% great, but boy-oh-boy that temper was a doozy.He'd never turned it on me before, but then again I'd never gone against hiswishes either. When my mother nearly died from an infection caused by hisinability to continue to care for her, I flew from southern California toSan Francisco to try to save her life-having no idea that in the process itwould nearly cost me my own. EARLY SIGNS OF DEMENTIA?I spent three months in the hospital nursing my 82-pound mother back torelative health, while my father went from being my loving dad one minute tocalling me horrible nasty names and throwing me out of the house the next. Iwalked on egg shells trying not to upset him, even running the washingmachine could cause a tizzy, and there was no way to reason with him. It wasso heart wrenching to have my once-adoring father turn against me.I immediately took my father to his doctor, only to be flabbergasted hecould act normal when he needed to. I could not believe it when the doctorlooked at me as if I was lying to her. She didn't even take me seriouslywhen I reported that my father had nearly electrocuted my mother, butfortunately I walked into the bathroom just three seconds before he pluggedin a huge orange power strip that was soaking in a white tub of saltwater-along with my mother's feet! Much later, I was furious to find out myfather had instructed his doctor (and everyone he came into contact with)not to listen to a thing I said because I was just a (bleep-bleep) liar-andall I wanted was his money! (I wish he had some.)Then things got serious. My father had never laid a hand on me my wholelife, but one day nearly choked me to death for adding HBO to histelevision, even though he had eagerly consented to it just a few daysbefore. Terrified, I dialed 911 for the first time in my life and when thepolice finally arrived they took him to a psychiatric hospital forevaluation. I could not believe it when they released him right away, sayingthey couldn't find anything wrong with him. What is even more astonishing isthat similar incidents occurred three more times. CAREGIVER CATCH 22After three months I was happy to finally bring my frail mother home fromthe hospital, but furious to find myself trapped. I couldn't fly home andleave my mother alone with my father-she'd surely die from his inability tocare for her. I couldn't get my father to accept a caregiver, and even whenI did-no one would put up with his raging very long. I couldn't gethealthcare professionals to help-my father was always so darling and sane infront of them. I couldn't get medication to calm him, and even when Ifinally did-he refused to take it, threw it in my face and flushed it downthe toilet. I couldn't place my mother in a nursing home-he'd just take herout. I couldn't put him in a home-he didn't qualify. They both refusedAssisted Living-and legally I couldn't force them. I became a prisoner in myparents' home for nearly a year trying to solve crisis after crisis, crying,begging for professional help-and infuriated with an unsympathetic medicalsystem that wasn't helping me appropriately. GERIATRIC DEMENTIA SPECIALIST MAKES DIAGNOSIS You don't need a medical doctorate degree to know something is wrong, butyou do need the right doctor who can diagnose and treat dementia properly.Finally, a friend suggested I call the Alzheimer's Association who directedme to the best neurologist in the area who specialized in dementia. Heperformed a battery of blood, neurological, memory tests and CT &amp; P.E.T.scans. After reviewing my parents' many medications and ruling out numerousreversible dementias such as a B-12 and thyroid deficiency, you should haveseen my face drop when he diagnosed Stage One Alzheimer's in both of myparents-something all their other healthcare professionals missed entirely. TRAPPED IN OLD HABITSWhat I'd been coping with was the beginning of Alzheimer's (just one type ofdementia), which begins very intermittently and appears to come and go. Ididn't understand that my father was addicted and trapped in his own badbehavior of a lifetime and his habit of yelling to get his way was comingout over things that were over-the-top illogical... at times. I also didn'tunderstand that demented does not mean dumb (a concept not widelyappreciated) and that he was still socially adjusted never to show his'Hyde' side to anyone outside the family. Even with the onset of dementia,it was astonishing he could still be so manipulative and crafty. On theother hand, my mother was as sweet and lovely as she'd always been. KEY: BALANCE BRAIN CHEMISTRY!I learned that Alzheimer's makes up 60-80% of all dementias and there's nostopping the progression nor is there yet a cure. However, if identifiedEARLY there are four FDA approved medications that can mask the symptoms,keeping a person in the early independent stage longer, delaying the needfor part to full-time supervision and care. The medications are Aricept,Exelon, Razadyne and Namenda, with many more in clinical trials. Incombination with optimal lifestyle changes (proper nutrition, weight,exercise, socialization), a one month delay in nursing home placement ofAlzheimer's patients could save the U.S. $1 BILLION annually. A five yeardelay in the onset could save $50 BILLION in annual healthcare costs. Publicawareness, education, and more research dollars are needed!After the neurologist masked the symptoms of Alzheimer's in my parents, andalso treated their depression (often present in AD patients), he prescribeda small dose of anti-aggression medication for my father, which helpedsmooth out is his volatile temper without making him sleep all day. (Ohhh,if we'd only had that fifty years ago!) It wasn't easy to get the dosagesright and took a lot of time and patience (no, he wasn't suddenly turnedinto a perfect angel), but at least we didn't need police intervention anylonger! CREATIVE BEHAVIORAL TECHNIQUESOnce my parents' brain chemistries were better balanced, I was able tooptimize nutrition, fluids, medication, treatments, and exercise with muchless resistance. I was also able to implement techniques to cope with theintermittent bizarre behaviors. Instead of logic and reason-I useddistraction and redirection to something they were interested in. I learnedto use reminiscence and talk about the old days, capitalizing on theirlong-term memories which were still quite good. Instead of arguing thefacts-I agreed, validated frustrated feelings, and lived in their realitiesof the moment. Instead of crying, I learned to just 'go with the flow' andlet any nasty comments roll off. And if none of that worked, a bribe of ice cream worked the best to cajolemy father into the shower, even as he swore a blue streak at me that he'djust taken one yesterday (over a week ago). I was also finally able to getmy father to accept two caregivers (he'd only alienated 40 that year-mostonly there for about ten minutes), and then with the tremendous benefit ofAdult Day Health Care five days a week for my parents and a support groupfor me, everything finally started to fall into place.IF ONLY WE HAD LONG TERM CARE INSURANCE!Before long my parents' life savings was gone and we were well into mine. Iwas advised to apply for Medicaid for them and after months of paperwork,aggravation, and evaluation they were approved for financial help from thegovernment. I was so relieved, until I learned that it would only pay to putmy parents in a nursing home, not keep them at home with 24/7 care. And,since my mother needed so much more skilled care than my father, they'd beseparated, something they would never consent to-nor did I want to do afterall this work to keep them together.I could not believe it-I finally had everything figured out medically,behaviorally, socially, legally, emotionally, two wonderful caregivers inplace, the house elder-proofed, and all I needed was some financial help tokeep them at home. If I'd just made sure my parents bought Long Term CareInsurance (or I bought it for them) years ago while they were still healthyand before any diagnosis of dementia, it would have covered the cost oftheir care at home. Instead, I paid for it, which nearly wiped me out inevery way. After five years of managing 24/7 care for my parents, I thensurvived invasive Brst. Cancer. ALZHEIMER'S / DEMENTIA OFTEN OVERLOOKEDWhat is so unsettling is that not one healthcare professional discussed thepossibility of the beginning of Alzheimer's Disease (or any type ofdementia) in my parents with me that first year, which happens far too oftento families. Alzheimer's afflicts more than 5.4 million Americans, butmillions go undiagnosed for 5-10 years because intermittent subtle warningsigns are chalked up to stress and just a 'normal' part of aging. Since oneout of eight by age 65, and nearly half by age 85 get AD, healthcareprofessionals of every specialty should know the 'Ten Warning Signs ofAlzheimer's' and educate their patients and families early on so everyonesaves time, money-and a fortune in Kleenex!TEN WARNING SIGNS OF ALZHEIMER'S(Reprinted with permission of the Alzheimer's Association)1.

It's Only Alzheimer's, Not the Bloody Plague!A friend recently said to me, “When my friends learned I had Alzheimer’s, many looked at me as if I had some kind of contagious disease. Then, they just stopped calling or coming around. Don’t they know it isn’t the bloody plague?”What It's NotI’ve spent eight years with people who were in various  stages of Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. Although my hospice patients in San Francisco were all in the later stages, I heard painful stories from their families of how people reacted to them when they still could function with some help.From others who are in the earlier stages, I heard identical stories involving relatives, long-time friends, and close colleagues who drifted away or interacted with them as if they :-Stepped back into their childhood-Possessed the mind of a developmentally delayed child.-Or became psychoticNone of these are true, yet as a society, we treat those with dementia as if at least one of these misconceptions was the gospel.The Harm We CauseWhen we act out of ignorance, we may unintentionally cause immense harm to those who are struggling with the disease. One person with dementia, who held a Ph.D. in chemistry, no longer would order a meal from a fast-food chain because, according to him, "The server made me feel like a moron” when he couldn’t quickly decide what to order from a board menu containing more than 50 items, with a multitude of combinations.Changing IdentitiesAs memories are lost and the ability to manage those that remain becomes a struggle, the identities of people with dementia change. We all view ourselves—our identity—by the roles we play, the activities we enjoy, the affiliations we have, the values that structure our lives, our abilities, and relationships. Imagine how your life would be transformed if significant parts of your identify disappeared--sometimes quickly, at other times slowly, and maybe the worse, stealthily.And It’s not only self-perceptions that create identities, but also how others perceive us. Imagine what it must have been like for that chemist who spent 8 years in graduate school and was involved in the development of life-saving drugs to be afraid of ordering a hamburger from someone who possibly never graduated high school.Pulling the Sharp Points CloseLife is full of choices. We can run away from those with the disease, either out of ignorance or fear of what we might eventually become, or we can choose to put ourselves in the place of someone with dementia. Tibetans have a saying that if you want to get over the fears in your life--the sharp points--bring them closer, rather than running away.But, eventually, you won't be able to run away from Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia. Statistics say that many of you reading this article will develop dementia. If you’re 60, you have a 1% chance of developing some form of dementia and your risk increases every year until you reach 85 when it levels off to 35%. If you have a parent with early onset Alzheimer’s your chances of developing the disease dramatically increase. And if you don’t know someone who is close to you with Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia, trust me, you will.How to HelpIn many ways, having dementia it’s like being dropped into a strange country with customs and a language you don’t understand. And just as you’re learning how to maneuver your way, something changes and you have to start all over again. And nobody is there to provide you with a GPS for getting out.So how would you react if was your spouse, your parent or a friend who had dementia? Instead of providing lists of “shouldisms” and going into the specifics of Alzheimer’s and dementia (see the links above), I thought I’d just suggest some things to consider the next time you interact with a person who has or you suspect has dementia.Be Patient. It may take longer to process informationMemories are not willingly lost. There will be things someone with dementia won’t remember, both recent and distant. Not remembering has nothing to do with not trying.Accept changes. Dementia is progressive. The person’s abilities today may be different tomorrow.Offer help to the person. There are few things more frightening then being disorientated, such as being a few blocks away from your house and not knowing how to get home. When you see someone who is obviously confused, don’t be afraid to offer help. The worse that happens is they say “No thank you.” The best that happens is you'll provide unimaginable comfort to another human being.Offer Help to the Caregiver. Unless someone has been a long-term caregiver, they have no idea of the effort it takes. Offer to help. Anything will be appreciated. Knowing that people care is a blessing to the person receiving the offer, and as my mother would say a "mitzvah" to the person making the offer.You live in different worlds. As with any chronic or terminal disease, almost everything is seen through the perceptual filters of the disease, from noises to the frustrated looks of fast food cashiers.Be Compassionate. Imagine the person with dementia is your parent who you love dearly. How would you want other people to interact with him or her and even more importantly, what would you want them to feel after the interaction?Leave Them With the Best You Have to OfferYes, the person you once knew as gregarious will eventually withdraw inward to the point where you may not be able to connect with them. But that may be years away. Enjoy their presence while you still can and offer them the support and compassion you would want if it was you who were slowly moving on a one-way road to a strange, structureless place.We don’t know what the person with dementia takes with them to that place we’re not allowed to enter. But doesn’t it make sense to give them memories that are pleasant rather than ones that aren’t?Stan Goldberg is author of Lessons for the Living: Stories of Forgiveness, Gratitude, and Courage at the End of Life. It has received six major national and international awards. His new book, Leaning Into Sharp Points: Practical Guidance and Nurturing Support for Caregivers will be published by New World Library in March, 2012.

Creativity &amp; Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer’s disease leads to nerve cell death and tissue loss throughout the brain. Over time, the brain shrinks dramatically, affecting nearly all of its functions. Alzheimer's ultimately affects all parts of the brain but each person is affected differently as the disease progresses. In part, this is due to the nature and extent of damage being caused to different areas of the brain. Each section of the brain is known as a lobe; a lobe simply means a part of an organ. Because the portion of the brain that deals with creativity is often one of the last portions of the brain that is affected by Alzheimer's disease, providing creative outlets for those affected in an important activity. In the earliest stages, before symptoms can be detected with testing, plaques and tangles, which are the hallmarks of the disease, begin to form in brain areas involved in:Learning and memoryThinking and planningIn the mild to moderate stages, brain regions develop more plaques and tangles than were present in early stages. As a result, individuals develop problems with memory or thinking serious enough to interfere with work or daily life. They may also get confused and have trouble handling money, expressing themselves and organizing their thoughts. Many people with Alzheimer’s disease are first diagnosed in this stage.Plaques and tangles also spread to areas involved in:Speaking and understanding speech Sense of where your body is in relation to objectsIn the advanced stages of Alzheimer’s disease, most of the cortex is seriously damaged. The cerebral cortex is a sheet of neural tissue that is the outermost part of the brain. It plays a key role in memory, attention, perception, thought, language and consciousness. During this stage of the disease, the brain shrinks dramatically due to widespread cell death. Individuals lose their ability to communicate, to recognize family and loved ones and to care for themselves. The right hemisphere of the brain is associated with the creative process. It conveys feeling, imagination, symbols and images in the present and future. It processes philosophical &amp; religious beliefs, special perception, form and abstract thoughts. Alzheimer's disease has a profound impact on creativity. Alzheimer's disease attacks the right posterior part of the brain, which enables people to retrieve internal imagery and copy images. Alzheimer's disease patients may lose the ability to copy images entirely. However, people with Alzheimer's disease can continue to produce art by using their remaining strengths, such as color or composition instead of shapes or realism.Dr. Luis Fornazzari, a researcher from the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and the University of Toronto and clinical director of the Multilingual/Multicultural Memory Clinic believes the association between creativity and mental illness is an area worth exploring.As part of his research, Dr. Fornazzari began studying the life of an artist who is suffering from  Alzheimer’s disease. Danae Chambers was commissioned to paint portraits of dignitaries around Canada and abroad. Her artwork has been shown in galleries around the world. Because of her disease, Ms. Chambers had a dramatic deterioration of communication, memory and life skills, but she could still paint beautifully. Traditionally, the approach in treating Alzheimer's disease and related dementias focused on what is not functioning in the patient, such as memory loss and difficulties with daily life and communication. By focusing on abilities instead of cognitive deficits, Dr. Fornazzari is pioneering a new approach in the treatment of Alzheimer disease and related dementia.  "The distinctiveness of Danae Chambers' story is that while examining her, we concentrated on the positive aspects of what was still functioning in her brain, such as her creative ability," says Dr. Fornazzari. Many times patients in the advanced stages of the disease are isolated and have no means of any form of communication. The study suggests that quality of life is improved when patients are given the opportunity to express themselves in any form and it provides scientists an avenue to explore brain function.The artists’ cognitive abilities were evaluated at four years, two years before and two years after the time she was admitted to a long term care facility in Toronto. Dr. Fornazzari monitored how her creativity emerged during the progressive course of the disease, while her other cognitive functions such as attention, working memory, and language ability increasingly deteriorated.  "Ms. Chambers' case clearly demonstrates that the brain uses separate neural pathways for creative expression compared to neural networks used for speech, memory and attention," says Dr. Fornazzari. "This is of profound importance to further understand and explore why Alzheimer's disease preferentially attacks one neural pathway over the other."  Dr. Fornazzari strongly advocates that creativity in any of its forms, either visual, musical, literary or performing arts should be actively explored in relation to patients with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias, especially when their other cognitive functions do not allow caregivers and specialists to communicate with sufferers of the disease. This effort to focus on the preserved creative functions, instead of deficits of the patient, will improve their quality of life and is a rewarding way for caregivers to communicate with them.
