<sent id="14">  Familial AD , which is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern , is caused by mutations in the amyloid precursor protein -LRB- APP -RRB- gene on chromosome 21 , the presenilin 1 gene on chromosome 14 , or the presenilin 2 gene on chromosome 1 . </sent> <sent id="15">  These mutations all lead to excessive production of a protein called beta amyloid -LRB- Abeta -RRB- . </sent> <sent id="16">  With this genetic form of AD , if the gene is carried there is near 100per cent likelihood that the person will develop AD if they live beyond 60 years . </sent>
